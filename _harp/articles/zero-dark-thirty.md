It’s hard to make a movie to which everyone knows the ending. Correction – it’s hard to make a good movie. Director Kathryn Bigelow, who won an Oscar for her previous movie, ‘The Hurt Locker’, attempted just that with ‘Zero Dark Thirty’, which covers the years and hours leading up to the capture and kill of Osama Bin Laden. That’s a subject that was bound to draw people to the cinema, out of sheer curiosity if not patriotism.

So, in pouring rain, we made our way to the Renoir Curzon cinema in the Brunswick Centre, a short walk away from SOAS. With an elegant Art Deco feel to it, the Renoir makes one think of different times, when cinemas were exciting and packed, the ladies always stylish, and the popcorn much less than 5 pounds, for if there’s a downside to this fancy establishment, it’s the steep prices and the lack of student discounts.
On the other hand, with two cinema theatres, the Renoir offers something for all tastes, mainstream and out-of-the-ordinary alike. On a rainy Monday night however, the cinema was quite empty, so we had our pick of seats, and sat down for what proved to be a very long three hours.

Zero Dark Thirty is a movie about America’s loss of innocence. It focuses on Maya (Jessica Chastain), a CIA agent sent to Pakistan to train as an interrogator in the (in)famous US detainee camps (pre-Abu Ghraib scandal).

Throughout the movie, we see her change from a soft-spoken, pale-skinned, red-haired epitome of delicacy to a tough-skinned, foul-mouthed, no-nonsense motherfucker. This transformation happens against the backdrop of the post 9/11 hunt for Bin Laden and the intensification of al-Qaida’s violent presence in the world.

The other main character is, of course, Osama bin Laden, every American’s Bogeyman, who permeates the actions and fears of all; every violent scene, from the torture of prisoners by the Americans to the many suicide bombings shown are meant to drive home just how necessary Osama’s death is.

It would be wrong to call this movie a tear-jerker, but it’s definitely a sympathy-jerker; after all, when your story eventually builds up to killing a man, you need to have a good reason for it, and a sympathetic audience.

Throughout the movie, even if there are moments where it looks like America’s actions might be criticized (seeing President Obama halfway through talking about how America doesn’t torture prisoners is priceless), you still get a sense of the need for justification, of an implied ‘necessary evil’, that is supposed to bring viewers and American society alike to believe that in the end, his death was worth it.

What the movie also does, perhaps inadvertently, is show how glorified this death was, like it could ever somehow compensate for the thousands who died because of al-Qaida, US citizens and Afghanis alike. “So, where do you want to go to now?” is the last sentence of the movie, addressed to Maya as much as to the States.

ZD30 has generated a lot of controversy, not least because of how it portrays this already-loaded subject, and the Oscar nomination Jessica Chastain received for her portrayal of Maya has done nothing but add fuel to the fire.

Although too long, it’s definitely a movie one should see to better understand how the mainstream narrative of al-Qaida functions in the American conscience.
