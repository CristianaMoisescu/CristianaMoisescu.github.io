*Forced marriages are more common than we like to think, and the practice is spreading to universities as well. **Cristiana Moisescu** reports.*

In an empty classroom, in the silence before the outpouring of her story, Amira (names have been changed to protect anonymity), 21, a SOAS final year student, chips at her purplish nail polish. Jet-black hair falls over hazel eyes and as she begins to talk rapidly, with no hint of hesitation, I see that she has a sweet voice, which matches her looks, still child-like. All this makes her story even more disturbing.

She recounts how, while in secondary school, she had her first boyfriend, who also happened to be white; in the eyes of her parents, that was a double wrong, so upon finding out, they took her out of school and prevented her from sitting her GCSEs. It was only through the help of a teacher who noticed her absence that she finally sat her exams, and then, once enrolled in an all-girls sixth form, she proceeded to take her A levels.

“They let me do my A levels, but I didn’t have a phone, I couldn’t go out, it was just go to school, come back home. So I worked super super hard so I could get into uni and get away from it all, but when the time came I was never allowed to go, even though I had offers at universities outside of London,” she says.

She took a gap year and reapplied to London universities, hoping that the proximity to home would make her father change her mind. When that didn’t work, “the only thing that he could think of was if I got married – that way my dad wouldn’t have to be worried that I would go off with other guys. At that time I was his responsibility and it would have affected his honour, [whereas] if I’m married, I’m affecting my husband‘s honour”.

An Islamic marriage, a niqah, was organized between her and a family friend who lived close by, and Amira was allowed to attend SOAS when term started. “I went on to lead a relatively normal life, but always knowing that [my husband] is there. When I was at university I would pretend that everything was fine and that I’m just like everyone else and enjoying my time, and when I went home, I would remember, ‘oh, I’m married, and I have to spend time with him and he’s a complete stranger [...] and there was this scary, emotional stress. The first year was really hard.”

Even though she was now married and going to university, Amira describes how her father would perform random checks in her bedroom, looking for clues as to her ‘bad’ behaviour, a practice that had started while she was still in secondary school, after he discovered that she had a boyfriend.

In the immediate aftermath of the discovery, Amira’s mother began sleeping on the floor of her daughter’s room, and if Amira then thought that it must be a form of spying on her, she has now come to understand that her mother had been frightened by the possibility of an honour killing, and so was trying to protect her.

 At the same time, since her high-school romance was discovered, her father hadn’t spoken to her again, and still doesn’t. As a way to make herself understand her marriage and new life, she told her friends that she was engaged, “that it was my choice, that he was really nice and I really liked him, and that we got engaged because our families wanted us to, but we actually liked each other. [...] So I kind of spun it so that this was something that I wanted, I tried to make it something more acceptable to myself and to my friends.”

Towards the end of her three years of university and marriage, Amira found herself in an impossible position, in a marriage she had only accepted so that she could attend higher education, but a marriage that was nonetheless real, with all its long-term implications.

As the age gap between her and her husband began to show (she is 21, he is 27), they started fighting. These days, a divorce is an unpleasant, but feasible part of life; in Amira’s case, divorce would have meant the end of her university studies. The way she sees it, “it was quite a unique and crazy situation to be in, I didn’t want that marriage, but I was fighting for that marriage”.

Anicee van Engeland, Lecturer in Law at SOAS, says that forced marriage often occurs in conjunction with attending higher education: “Some girls go to university and then they get married after, but in some cases they get married and then they can go to university; but when you do that, you have to make sure that in the marriage contract it’s clearly written that they will let you go to university, because if it’s not written, the husband takes guardianship over you and then can prevent you from going.”

In the case of larger families, “once the first girl has negotiated access to university in exchange for marriage after, she has also negotiated for her sisters, so she cannot misbehave, because if she does, she closes the door for her sister, so it’s extremely stressful.”

Ayndrilla Singharay, Training and Development co-coordinator at ASHA, a South Asian organisation that works to end violence against women and girls, and which deals with a lot of cases of forced marriage, agrees with this. University is  seen “as an important time phase in a young woman’s life when it could happen; at the end of school and between university, that period is when a young woman is most at risk, because age is a factor. Often they’re pulled out of education before university, so they slip through the net.”

Being in a forced marriage has a lot of implications on different legal, social and psychological levels. Asking ‘why don’t they just leave?’ is not the right question, because a forced marriage weaves a web of complexities around it.

Singharay’s experience at ASHA gives her the insight to know that “it’s extremely hard to leave; we’re talking about very young girls here, 16, 17 year-olds, just leaving their whole families, their siblings, their school, their friends, and coming to a refuge. You don’t know what’s going to happen, you’re living on your own at that age, with no kind of support, and really, you miss your family, and regardless of what they’ve done to you or wanted you to do, you still love your parents.[...] And the community...it’s often very shameful if a girl leaves the family or if she gets other institutions involved, such as the police or social services, that would bring shame to the family as well, so they will be very isolated.”

From her discussions throughout the years with students who have admitted to being in a forced marriage, Van Engeland confirms this: “They were saying to me that they can’t live without their communities, that they don’t know how to live without one, that losing the respect of their family and their community – they wouldn’t be able to cope with it. So [leaving] would basically be a social death.”

Amira’s story follows this exact pattern, as she admits that “technically I could leave, I’m a lot older now, I could just leave, but it would mean I’d never see my mum again. And if I ran away, it would be worse for my dad’s honour, because up until now, [...] it was kept quiet. As soon as I ran away, questions would arise, why did she leave, and he could take it out on my mum or take it out on my sister and not let her go to university.”

Legally, forced marriage is not a criminal offence in England and Wales, but there is a major government push towards its criminalization. Since at present it is feared that only a handful of people report being in this situation, criminalizing the practice has the great potential of further driving it underground.

At present, the only legislation regarding forced marriage is the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007, which entitles victims to apply for a protection order against their families.

A few years ago, while teaching at the University of Bedfordshire, Anicee Van Engeland studied the act together with some of her students, who had contacted her because they were about to be forcibly married: “We looked at it together, but the problem with the act was that it said that they have to denounce their families, which could put them in a very dangerous position, it could end up with an honour killing; but at the same time, are you really going to denounce your parents to the police? Try to put yourself in their shoes, would you do it? It’s such a big step.” Singharay confirms that not one of the cases the organization has dealt with since the act has been passed has ever wanted to prosecute their parents.

Forced marriage can take on a number of different forms, and it can and does target boys as well as girls, although the numbers in the case of the former are even less reported. Another problem is that sometimes, the marriages aren’t contracted legally, in civil courts, so in case there’s a divorce, it becomes very hard to legislate it under UK laws.

It’s also quite often that a UK national will be taken out of the country to their parents’ country of origin, in order to be married there, for reasons which could range from keeping family and financial ties strong across the continents, to obtaining a citizenship for a foreign national once they’re married to a UK one.

Every year, the Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) brings out a report of the cases they deal with in that timeframe.

The 2012 report shows that 1485 cases of possible forced marriage have been investigated and also, just how uneven forced marriage statistics look like: age wise, the youngest case was 2 and the oldest 71. People aged 18-21 (30%) make up the majority of cases, with 82% female victims, and 18% male victims. Pakistan had the highest incidence of cases at 47.1%, but the list of countries includes Iran, Nigeria and the Ukraine. 22 cases involved victims who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) (FMU – Statistics January to December 2012).

So who is more susceptible to ending up in a forced marriage? There is a prevailing assumption that forced marriage only takes place in the Muslim communities, or that it is condoned by Islam; in fact, all major religions publicly condemn forced marriages, and forced marriages happen to people in all major religions, including Christianity and its different denominations.

Singharay says that “if you look at the media, you would think that South-Asian women are the typical case, because it’s usually a young South Asian woman from a very religious family, but that’s not always the case. We’ve had girls from families which aren’t religious at all, it’s nothing to do with religion; you might think that it’s only working class families, or that they’re not very well off, that’s also not the case, we’ve had very well off young women also having pressure put on them to get married. It’s a set of ideals which a family or community holds and it plays out in different ways, there is no default case.”

In the end, she says, it all boils down to a form of domestic abuse, even if there is no physical violence involved.

In the end, Amira was lucky. She was able to obtain an Islamic divorce, and she has not been pulled out of university yet, while her younger sister has just been accepted to university and their parents seem inclined to let her go. Amira would like to move away after her degree at SOAS ends, and take her PGCEs, start afresh, but the threat of a new marriage might already be hanging above.  “My biggest thing right now is to try and move out, get a job and live by myself for a bit. If that won’t be possible, I'm scared of what will happen. This marriage has ended but what if they find someone else?”
