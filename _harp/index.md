Iâ€™m a Romanian-born, London-based journalist, writing about politics and social
issues. My main interests revolve around issues of race and gender, and the
regional politics of the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

Occasionally, I will venture into the world of culture, writing art, book and
movie reviews for [The Culture Trip](http://theculturetrip.com) and
[New Internationalist](http://newint.org/contributors/cristiana-moisescu/).

I graduated from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) with a
Politics degree, during which time I was Features Editor of the SOAS Spirit.
For my work there, I was runner-up in the NUS Awards for Best Student
Journalist of the Year in 2014.

After graduating, I went on to do a year-long editorial internship with
New Internationalist magazine. 

I am currently the editorial intern at [The Week](http://www.theweek.co.uk/) magazine.
