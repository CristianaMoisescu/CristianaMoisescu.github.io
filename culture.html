<ol>
<li>The Noise of Time by Julian Barnes</li>
</ol>
<p>In his first novel after &#39;The Sense of An Ending&#39;, which won the Man Booker Prize in 2011, Barnes recounts the life of Dmitri Shostakovich, the famed Soviet composer whose music and personal fortune were intricately linked to that of his country: in the span of a decade, he went from celebrated cultural landmark, to officially denounced for being too &#39;Western&#39;, and struggled all his life with the Communist Party&#39;s absolute rule over his music. </p>
<p>Barnes has written an ambitious book, says <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-noise-of-time-by-julian-barnes-book-review-author-misses-a-beat-a6801251.html">The Independent</a>, with a great historical approach, but &#39;we read him for an arresting story, and this is, sadly, not what we get&#39;.  On the contrary, this is &quot;a complex meditation on the power, limitations and likely endurance of art&quot;, says Alex Clark at the Guardian, who extolls Barnes for being &quot;neither afraid of extremely high-class erudition nor of writing about sausages. It is a useful skill to have if you want to keep your readers on their toes.&quot;</p>
<p>While you wait: Dreams of My Russian Summers, by Andrei Makine</p>
<p>Out on 28 January 2016</p>
<ol>
<li>The High Mountains of Portugal by Yann Martel</li>
</ol>
<p>This is &#39;Life of Pi&#39; author Yann Martel&#39;s fourth novel, and everyone&#39;s buzzing about it. It&#39;s not hard to understand why, as Martel is the winner of the 2002 Man Booker Prize for &#39;Life of Pi&#39;, the breakthrough book-turned-blockbuster movie. Starting in Lisbon, 1904, where Tomas finds an old journal hinting at a deep secret, the book weaves three different stories in a road-trip across four centuries and two continents, exploring themes of love, loss and heartbreak. It might even turn out to be a serious award contender, and even those who weren&#39;t pleased with Martel&#39;s latest book, &#39;Beatrice and Virgil&#39;, are putting this on their &#39;must-read&#39; lists for 2016.</p>
<p>While you wait: How to be both, by Ali Smith</p>
<p>Out on 02 February, 2016</p>
<ol>
<li>Thus Bad Begins by Javier Marías</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1980&#39;s Spain, a young man, Juan de Vere, finds himself trapped in an unsettling love triangle, as the assistant to a famous filmmaker, Eduardo Muriel. As Muriel&#39;s wife flits in and out of the book and into other people&#39;s beds, Juan is tasked by the jealous husband to find out all he can about one of her mysterious old friends, who seems to be inexplicably linked to the Franco regime. Javier Marías has a knack for exploring disquieting relationships (and pair them with Shakespeare themes, such as this Hamlet-inspired one), and this looks to be a similar affair.</p>
<p>While you wait: Rhapsody: A Dream Novel, by Arthur Schnitzler</p>
<p>Out on 25 February, 2016</p>
<ol>
<li>What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours by Helen Oyeyemi</li>
</ol>
<p>With five novels under her belt and a subsequent Granta nomination for Best Young British Novelists of 2013, Oyeyemi is one of Britain&#39;s new powerful voices. &#39;What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours&#39; is her first short story collection, inspired by fairy tales and dark secrets, magically reworked throughout the book. Short stories have sometimes been unfairly given a wide berth by readers, so Oyeyemi&#39;s book couldn&#39;t come at a better time. </p>
<p>While you wait: Dear Life, by Alice Munro</p>
<p>Out on 08 March 2016</p>
<ol>
<li>The Pier Falls by Mark Haddon</li>
</ol>
<p>He of &#39;The Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night-time&#39; fame will have his first collected short stories published this May. The stories touch upon dark themes such as war, abandonment and natural disasters, all leading to a death of sorts - his wife apparently asked him to write at least one where no one dies - but <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/fiction-this-week-mark-haddon-2015-11-16">Haddon</a> says they &quot;are bound together by an empathy for sometimes unlovable people in difficult situations&quot;. If your interest is piqued, you can read the first of these, &#39;The Pier Falls&#39;, <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/04/pier-falls-new-short-story-mark-haddon">here</a>.</p>
<p>While you wait:  The Bazaar of Bad Dreams, by Stephen King</p>
<p>Out on 10 May, 2016</p>
<ol>
<li>Barkskins by Annie Proulx</li>
</ol>
<p>Annie Proulx has spent ten years working on her latest novel, &#39;Barkskins&#39;, and it looks set to become a bestseller even before its publication. Set in 17th century New France, the book spans across generations to tell the story of two French settlers and their trials and sorrows, reaching all the way to China and New Zealand. The book has already been picked up by Scott Rudin Productions, which will turn it into a miniseries, set to premiere globally in 171 countries and 45 languages. Can this be the new Brokeback Mountain?</p>

<li>Here I Am by Jonathan Safran Foer</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet another highly anticipated book, &#39;Here I Am&#39; is Jonathan Safran Foer&#39;s first novel since 2005, and there&#39;s already much hype around it. Set in today&#39;s Washington, DC, it follows the implosion of an American-Jewish family over the course of a month, as divorce and tragedy take hold of their lives, while overseas, a massive earthquake rocks the Middle East and Israel&#39;s political foundations. &quot;It’s got this high-wire inventiveness and intensity of imagination in it,&quot; says Foer&#39;s editor Eric Chinski, while the <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/new-novel-from-jonathan-safran-foer-coming-in-september/?_r=0">New York Times</a> is quick to point out some interesting autobiographical similarities. </p>
<p>While you wait: Portnoy&#39;s Complaint, by Phillip Roth</p>
<p>Out in September 2016 </p>

Seeing them immediately evokes the richness of her paintings, while poignantly offering an insight into her life. This is the effect of the Ishiuchi Miyako: Frida exhibition at Michael Hoppen Gallery, which collect’s Miyako photography of Kahlo’s wardrobe and belongings.</p>
<p>Until recently, most of these personal items were locked up in the dark, in a room in the ‘Casa Azul’, Frida’s house-turned-museum in Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. Her husband, painter Diego Rivera, had them stored there, to be presented to the public 15 years after his death. In fact, the room was only opened in 2004, uncovering aspects of Frida no album had catalogued so far (who knew she liked Revlon nail polish, in a deep, fiery pink, the name of which was ‘Orchid to you’?)</p>
<p>Japanese artist Ishiuchi Miyako was invited to photograph the items, which numbered over 300. Of these, only a handful are on display here, carefully arranged to paint the most subtle of portraits: there are hints at her illness, a testimony of her insatiable drive to create, her dark femininity.</p>
<p>The photos themselves seem to float in mid-air, echoing a dream-like Frida, who only exists in our imagination. What the real woman would have made of her personal memorabilia being showcased for everyone to see is hard to guess. These days, anything Frida elicits a strong response – her love letters to Spanish artist Jose Bartoli were auctioned off in April for $137,000 – and this glimpse into her private life is no exception.</p>
<p>Still, the viewer here is prevented from getting too close: the photographs are ethereal, hypnotic and the effect is hard to associate with the smells and texture of clothing. Reality is held at bay, with long, black gloves stretching out into the whiteness around, far from inviting. When would she have worn them? Does it really matter? A corset with skirt attached seems to be echoing a Soviet astronaut’s gear – only a closer look reveals her hand and drawings on the hard plaster.</p>
<p>There are also hints of glamorous Frida, with cat-like sunglasses and a turquoise bathing suit – is there a Hollywood star beneath the paint dirt? Then there is the artist at work – in this case, hand-stitching skirts, decorating a fake boot to make it hers, dispersing her creative energy into her clothes, which have become extensions of herself.</p>
<p>All in all, Miyako’s photographs encapsulate different versions of this mythical woman, while keeping the real one at bay, free from curious looks intruding. In a way, it’s as if that locked room was never opened.</p>
<p>Ishiuchi Miyako: Frida runs at the Michael Hoppen gallery until 12 July 2015.</p>

<p><strong>How did you decide to make this documentary?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greg Barker:</strong> I was very interested in [the concept of] revolution and I spent a lot of time looking at how contemporary events were informed by actions of the past. I was inspired by the people who are standing up for the ideals that helped build the countries that we live in and wanted to tell a story that really explored what it takes to stand up to those ideals and the sacrifices that people have to make.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose those three countries?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> In a film like this, you can have an infinite number of choices so it’s really just through research and spending a lot of time with people… eventually, these were the ones that seemed to have an interesting way of telling a story.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong, it’s just making the choice that these particular characters, in these countries, represented the full scope of the revolutionary experience, from armed struggle to non-violence.</p>
<p><strong>The movie opens with interesting credits, depicting controversial revolutionary figures such as Lenin, Mao Zedong and Ayatollah Khomeini. Didn’t you fear that association?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> No matter what you think about Mao or Che or Lenin, just like the American revolutionaries, they actually talked a lot about revolutions. Whether you agree with what they did, they spent a lot of time thinking about what revolutions involve and what they entail and why they happen.</p>
<p>That’s an academic exercise that they all did, which is independent of what they then did in the course of their own revolutions.</p>
<p>When Zhou Enlai [..] was asked by [Henry] Kissinger what he thought about the French revolution, he said ‘it’s too early to tell’. These things take a long time.</p>
<p>These are people whom I wanted to reflect the full breadth of the revolutionary experience, because it’s not always pretty and it’s not always what we might like or even what the people who began it would have liked.</p>
<p>Khomeini’s revolution in Iran had the support of a broad segment of society and then changed quickly in the ensuing years. The French Revolution was about one thing and then turned into something else. It’s not an easy or a pretty process.
<strong>Watching the movie, it felt like you took a step back from what we’re seeing, but that you also left the context slightly unclear.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> You have to give a sense of the human drama, of the human experience of it all, rather than a report of what happened. So we all felt it was important to focus on the journey of these people and the ethical and tactical choices that they make along the way.</p>
<p>And because when you make a film like this, it’s not going to last for years – events change and the outcome now won’t be the outcome in five or 10 years – you make a film that is rooted in a moment in time. It doesn’t try to say: ‘This is where we are’.</p>
<p>The fact is, it would be outdated if we tried to do that. We finished this film in January, so much has already happened [since then]. You have to make the film in a way that you hope will stand the test of time, it’s very tricky when you’re dealing with current events, but that’s the nature of this art.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel that by focusing this much on these three families, and less on the context, you risk idealizing the figure of the revolutionary?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> I don’t think so. It’s pretty tragic what happens to all of them. What I would say is that it might be a noble path, but not one that I would want to take lightly. I don’t know that I would watch the film and think ‘I want to be a revolutionary’, probably on the contrary – but in the end, history is changed by people who do that.</p>
<p>Not for me to say that they’re idealized, but I think that if you look at key figures throughout history, often, people who are the idealists are the ones who leave their mark and stand the test of time. Lenin was also a revolutionary and an idealist in his own way, and things changed after the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>I think that if you look at [Mahatma] Gandhi, [Martin Luther] King, [Nelson] Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, these are people who stood up for something, and they were just ordinary people when they began their campaign – three years after they started, Mandela was in jail for life, King was still a fairly small time preacher in the South and Aung San Suu Kyi was still a mother. You can’t judge the impact of these people until time passes.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say we idealize it, but I think people who become heroes, do so in a way that, at the time you’re looking at them, looks pretty mundane and often hopeless, and the journey can seem almost irrelevant or foolish at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Still, knowing how perverted things have become in Syria, it seems that the path to revolution is not always noble. And the documentary didn’t really show that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB</strong>: It’s not always noble. Again, we’re not making a film that tries to explain all the context, I really wanted to show what happened when people began on a non-violent path, and then, for a lot of seemingly different, valid reasons, decide that they have to take up arms anyway. Like Mandela did, actually. It’s a common phenomenon; it’s the price they paid, the consequence.</p>

<p>Maryam al Khawaja is a dual national, Danish and Bahraini. Her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, has been in prison since 2011, following protests against he Bahraini government, and her sister and mother have been arrested as well. Maryam was arrested on 30 August 2014, when she landed in Manama, Bahrain, trying to visit her family.</p>
<p><strong>The documentary leaves off with your sister in and out of jail, you still abroad, but things have changed since then. You’ve managed to go back to Bahrain twice and you were arrested there in August.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maryam al-Khawaja:</strong> Things changed – Zainab [Maryam’s sister] got out seven months ago, in February; I went back and got arrested, I went to prison for a while and then I got out [in September 2014]. Now things are back to where they started: I’m outside, doing advocacy work, and Zainab’s back in prison.</p>
<p><strong>And she’s eight months pregnant too. Do you think she’s going stay in prison until she gives birth?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> Yes, she had a hearing. It was supposed to be a sentencing, but the judge adjourned the trial until 4 December. My analysis is that it’s probably related to the fact that there are elections happening on 22 November, and so it’s really bad PR to sentence her right now.</p>
<p>But it also means that because she’s in her last month of pregnancy, she will probably be giving birth during her imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong>You do a lot of advocacy work, and are very public about it, and so is your family. Have you or your family ever had any qualms about taking part in this documentary?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> The documentary hasn’t been made fully public yet [at the time of the interview] so I haven’t really seen what the response from the public is generally going to be.</p>
<p>I do know that in the past, we have had criticism from people saying ‘You’re doing this to be in the spotlight, this is all about you’. I’ve heard that kind of talk before.</p>
<p>It was because of the position that I was in, doing the human rights work that I was doing and getting a lot of interviews. And it was mostly non-Bahrainis, but people were saying ‘You’re doing this because you want the attention.’</p>
<p>Which is fair enough, they’re entitled to their opinion. I think that for us, what’s been challenging, and this is something that was a challenge for me about the documentary itself.</p>
<p>When Razan Ghalayini [co-producer] first contacted me about the documentary, first, she asked me a lot of questions, and I thought she was working for Bahraini intelligence, so I didn’t want to talk to her.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I told her that my only reservation about doing this documentary, the only way that I would agree to do it, is if they promise to make sure that it’s about Bahrainis, about Bahrain, even if we’re in it. That it’s about the Bahraini struggle, not about us.</p>
<p>So I don’t mind us being used as a vessel to bring out the story of what people are going through inside the country. That’s the way I see myself, as an amplifier to people who don’t’ have a voice inside the country.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like the documentary accurately portrays that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> To a large degree yes, I think it talks about what’s going on in Bahrain. They gave me and my sister the space to talk about how we are not what matters when it comes to Bahrain, how it’s about the people’s struggle. For me, that was very important.</p>
<p>Our job is to fight for those people, that’s our responsibility. Even if the movie was mainly about me and my sister and my family, I feel like it gave us an opportunity to talk about what you will usually not hear in Bahrain.</p>
<p><strong>There was a very striking image in the documentary, with men and women on either side of a large avenue, protesting, but separated. In Bahrain, how relevant is that image for daily interaction between men and women, in politics, in social spaces?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> It is and it isn’t. I know that when they see that image, generally, people’s reaction is ‘Oh, Muslims, they separate men and women.’ For me, it’s pretty impressive that they’re walking alongside each other.</p>
<p>There’s no space in the street to be walking next to each other, but the fact that the women are not walking behind the men is an important image.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes, it’s just about being comfortable. I’ve been in those protests and I’m what you may call a liberal. For me, it wasn’t an issue of being around men or not, it was about being in all of this together.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was more comfortable to not be in a position where I’m constantly around men and in a very small space. Sometimes, it’s just more comfortable to be around women. It’s not necessarily something that was done as a statement of separation between the sexes.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel that as an activist, your access to doing certain things has been restricted or freed up by the fact that you’re a woman?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> That’s not a very easy question to answer. I know that some of the platforms that I’ve gotten, I got because I wear a hijab. And because I’m a woman of colour.</p>
<p>People are saying ‘Oh look, there’s this Arab hijabi woman… check check check, she knows how to speak English very well, she’s talking about human rights and revolutions, we have to have her on this platform’.</p>
<p>I know that my identity and the way I look actually gets me access to some places. And I make use of it. I don’t necessarily always like it; I don’t like the fact that I’m profiled. For example, I’ve gotten invitations in the past asking me to come and talk about Muslim women’s issues.</p>
<p>But I don’t represent Muslim women, I represent myself; and even if I talked about Muslim women’s issues in Bahrain, they’re not going to be the same that people deal with in other places. And I’m not familiar with every issue that Muslim women deal with.</p>
<p>There is to some extent, that pigeonholing, but at the same time, it also provides me with more access; it’s a double edged sword.</p>
<p>For me, it’s about how to make the most of it. And it’s the same thing when I’m talking in places where there is support for the Bahraini government.</p>
<p>For example, a few years ago, my family got an award from a US organization and people were telling me ‘How can you go there, how can you accept this award? These are people who are representing the US government, which is enabling the Bahraini government’.</p>
<p>What I did was, I accepted that award, but I stood there and I bashed US policy in Bahrain. I used my entire speech just to talk about how bad US policy is towards Bahrain. So they might be doing it for the wrong reasons, but I will make use of that platform to get our message out.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell me a bit about your background as an artist?</strong></p>
<p>I started in 2005, and I work mainly with live art: sometimes I perform in my pieces, sometimes not, but they’re always interactive. The audience makes the piece happen. ‘Gardens Speak’ is an interactive sound installation, almost performed by the audience themselves.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get the idea for this project?</strong></p>
<p>The idea was generated by a photograph I saw at the start of the Syrian uprising, in 2011, of a woman digging a grave for her own son, in her garden – a domestic garden. What really struck me in this photo was that it was very powerful and very telling about what’s happening there now, about how people’s lives and intimacy are turning into a grave. It was also quite delicate… it just affected me for a long time.</p>
<p>I became interested in the places of burial in Syria during the uprising, and why that was happening, and how it became a common practice to bury the dead in gardens, whether domestic gardens, home gardens or communal parks, communal gardens, even gardens where kids play. And I had some friends inside Syria who would send me photos of kids playing in the park, but at the same time you can see that right next to them there are graves which have been recently dug.</p>
<p>This was partly because people couldn’t get to the main burial sites, because of shelling or checkpoints; what was also quite telling for me was the fact that the Syrian regime was targeting funerals, because some of them were turning into protests, turning into celebrations of the lives of the activist or the revolutionary or even the civilian who had died at the hands of the regime, so it was a celebration of their lives and their common struggle. The regime was targeting these funerals, and these funerals would generate more death.</p>
<p>Also, at some point, the narrative of people’s deaths was contested – the regime would force the family to write or sign papers saying things like their loved one had been killed by armed insurgents, or something like that, forcing the living to betray the dead.
This is where the idea came from, that this regime is not only oppressive when you live with it, it oppresses even after you die, it follows you at the site where you are being buried, follows you in the narrative of your death. I wanted to challenge that, resist it by telling the stories of 10 real people and what happened to them and their dreams – people who were buried in their gardens, rewriting their own history.</p>
<p><strong>‘Gardens speak’ offers such a different view to the Syrian uprising from what we see in the media. What do you think is the main function of that?</strong></p>
<p>Oral histories always challenge the grand narratives of the regime, of the Western media or of the Arab media, who have their own agenda. Any oral history of ordinary people challenges that, or at least questions some of the things.</p>
<p><strong>The idea is slightly controversial – have you encountered any resistance to it?</strong></p>
<p>The project is still very new, and I haven’t shown it yet in the Arab world. So far people have been really moved by it – these are people’s stories and an it’s an experience where you get to reflect on what’s happening, but also to reflect on your own existence, on your own vulnerability, it allows you to grieve whatever you want to grieve for. It has been quite well-received.</p>
<p><strong>Would you say that the installation plays out as an interaction between collective death and the individual experience of death?</strong></p>
<p>I would say it’s about a collective struggle, not collective death; but also about individual people. And not only their death, but their life.</p>
<p>This regime is not only oppressive when you live with it, it oppresses even after you die. It follows you at the site where you are being buried, follows you in the narrative of your death
I thought a lot about how to write stories of people who were killed and I made a choice to not write the stories from the [perspective of the] moment they died, as if the most important moment was that they were killed, but [to write it] allowing their individual dreams, hopes, identities to appear.</p>
<p>So it’s very personal. Ten audience members experience it at a time, and each one hears the story of one person. In a way, it’s like a one-on-one performance.</p>
<p><strong>I know that you tried to incorporate people’s actual voices in the sound clips.</strong></p>
<p>I wrote the stories in the first person, as if they are told to us, and I also edited them with found material or material that was given to us of their own voices, or of the moment they were killed, or from when they were buried. So there are sounds of their burial, people digging, praying over them.</p>
<p><strong>How did you choose only 10 people from the many stories?</strong>
The idea was to have different scenarios, different stories from different parts of Syria – some of [the people] were part of the revolution, some were in an armed struggle, some were peaceful activists, some civilians. Different ages. It’s a selection of people, people whose families we managed to get in contact with, so as to actually obtain the personal information.</p>
<p><strong>What was the families’ reaction to ‘Gardens Speak’?</strong></p>
<p>The people that I personally talked to were very encouraging of the project and thought it was such a strong idea; they were very positive about it. However, most people who were in Syria were spoken to by a Syrian activist who was working with me on the project and who had a certain kind of, let’s say… credibility with them, so they knew about her, for various reasons; she was respected and that helped a lot, people opened up to her, as opposed to just this random Lebanese woman calling them for information.</p>
<p><strong>Why Syria and not another currently ongoing conflict?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t feel that the Syrian uprising has been very far from me, I feel quite affected by it. This is one of the main uprisings in the Arab world, with a big contested narrative, and which was let down by the global Left. While everyone was celebrating the Egyptian revolution, from the start, the Syrian uprising was judged and not really supported globally.</p>
<p>I feel that people forget that this was a legitimate uprising that started against a brutal dictator, a brutal regime, and which was forcibly oppressed and turned into a militarized resistance, with no help at all.</p>
<p>We tend to forget that and judge it all as a big civil war – that’s why I don’t really call it a civil war, because it’s a war against people by a powerful regime and I feel like there’s a lot to say there.
Also, [there is] the idea of a beautiful, peaceful, domestic, intimate space, turning into a nightmarish grave, a reminder that you’ve lost a very close person… for me this was disturbing, as an artist. So I didn’t necessarily decide to do something on Syria.</p>
<p><strong>How do grief and memory interplay here?</strong></p>
<p>Grief is a very important resistance tool – that’s not really my idea, a lot of people have written about it, in feminist theory, people like Judith Butler and Athena Athanasiou; the idea is that those who are killed are cannot even be grieved; that if we don’t know their names, hobbies, their life, then it’s easier to kill them.</p>
<p>So we mourn them and tell their stories as an act of resistance, hoping that this will make it more difficult for them to be killed.</p>
<p><strong>And to be forgotten.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah… but they won’t be forgotten by their community and their loved ones. And the world didn’t know them to start with in order to forget them, but it needs to, and to know their stories, that they were human beings who had hopes and lives and dreams like everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>How did you start getting involved with photography?</strong></p>
<p>I began taking pictures by chance. I was studying journalism and political science and decided to take a photo course out of curiosity and because I felt it would be an easy credit towards my degree.</p>
<p>I fell in love with photography quickly, but speaking from where I am now, I can honestly say I did not understand the full breadth of that passion back then.</p>
<p>My attraction to photography was seeing it as a platform with potential for artistic expression – limitless expression. My passion has always been to write and I still turn to writing to express emotions I am unable to articulate vocally.</p>
<p>Photography is my visual outlet for expression and reflection, mostly on personal issues but often on universal social issues to which I have an intimate connection.</p>
<p><strong>How hard was it to get access to your subjects, for this exhibition? Did you feel in danger at any time?</strong></p>
<p>It was never difficult to get access to people, which eventually became a problem for me. I know it usually works the other way around, but sometimes when people open their door too wide, you really understand the breadth of the responsibility you carry with you when you do this sort of work.</p>
<p>I am talking particularly about the series ‘Casualty’, which consists of portraits of widows and mothers who lost their children, as well as people who were wounded in clashes with police. This became an incredibly emotional and difficult series to work on and eventually I had to stop.
Many women cried when I was talking to them about their children and husbands. I don’t know, what do you do when this happens in front of you?</p>
<p>I realized I was reopening the unhealed wounds of these grieving mothers and I didn’t think my pictures were going to resolve their pain or lead to any resolution with the government, which is essentially what they were hoping for – to see the killers of their children and husbands face justice.</p>
<p>The last mother I met found the burnt corpse of her son in the River Nile. She showed me a mobile-phone photo they captured of the body as her young son, probably no older than seven, looked on. I looked at him, at the photo and back at her and realized I am not helping them, but traumatizing them even further.</p>
<p>I stand by the importance of telling the story of how people’s lives changed dramatically in their struggle for ‘Bread, Freedom and Social Justice’, which were the main things the 2011 revolution called for, but I think I had already achieved that through the series of portraits I had captured and did not need to rekindle the pain of any more families.</p>
<p>The rest of the work was on the streets, which is in many ways where I most feel at home, but also feel most vulnerable. But this tension is part of what I do and it’s something I have to deal with in order to make pictures, so I have learned to adapt. I almost always work alone, work quickly and move quickly and try not to attract too much attention.</p>
<p><strong>As a female photographer, have you ever felt like your access to the city was limited?</strong></p>
<p>The streets of Cairo are never a comfortable place. In fact, I am always terrified when I am on the street, but I realize that in order to photograph I have to put myself there.</p>
<p>It’s a very ‘dirty’ experience, not just because of the stares you constantly get for no reason but being a girl, but also the comments and the general vibe that there is nowhere for you to hide, no place to go. So that’s what I meant when I said I felt most vulnerable.</p>
<p>In the last year of working there, I bought a small taser that fits in my pocket. I never had to use it but felt some sense of ‘protection’ carrying it in my pocket. This was after a close encounter in Tahrir Square, when something was going to go very wrong, but luckily, it didn’t.
Cairo’s streets are extremely intimidating for me, but I decided to do this body of work and so had to force myself to confront my fear and intimidation.</p>
<p><strong>How did you gain the trust of your subjects?</strong></p>
<p>I strongly believe when you approach people with honesty and give them the respect they deserve, they sense that and open up to you.</p>
<p>I always told people what I was doing and explained to them that the project was something I was doing out of personal motivations with no guarantee that it would be published. Sometimes people said no; in fact, many did, but some said yes. I have to respect people’s choices.</p>
<p>However, many people in Egypt really wanted to be heard. I think this stems from living under a regime where they were being silenced for so many years. There is a huge sense of responsibility once people let you in on their lives and start to talk about intimate and sensitive moments.</p>
<p>Many women cried when I was talking to them about their children and husbands. I don’t know, what do you do when this happens in front of you?</p>
<p>It’s an awful situation to be in, but you are there and you have to do something. Naturally, I wanted [to use] the picture with the tears because it is storytelling, but from a human perspective, I couldn’t do it. In this situation, I was there as an Egyptian first, photographer second.</p>
<p><strong>There have been so many different depictions of the events in Tahrir Square. Has that been intimidating for a photographer or, on the contrary, exhilarating?</strong></p>
<p>A woman wears the hijab (sheer fabric covering her neck and hair) at a park in Old Cairo. The influx of women covering their hair in Egypt is a sign of a country in turmoil over its identity. Laura el-Tantawy</p>
<p>I don’t find it intimidating. I think it’s important to have many perspectives and often having such an influx of images allows for the really powerful ones to rise to the surface. But on the other end of this, having so many images can develop visual immunity or story fatigue, so it’s a fine line.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of the photos have an almost dream-like quality, like a mirage. What’s the reasoning behind that?</strong></p>
<p>This is hard for me to address because it’s not something I do intentionally. It just happens to be the way I see and feel in these situations. When I began to photograph Egypt in 2005, it was at a very difficult time in my life and I used the streets of Cairo as the backdrop for my search for identity.
I had to discover where I belong on the streets in order to know where I belong in the country. My work gained more urgency with the political turmoil, but essentially I continued to search for who I am.</p>
<p>Egypt is a real and unreal place for me and I believe this visually transmits itself through the images. My inspiration primarily comes from music, poetry and impressionistic painters – my photographic influences tend to be poetic and painterly like, such as the work of Gueorgui Pinkhassov, Miguel Rio Branco and Saul Leiter.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, is there a case to be made for more Global South photographers/reporters, as opposed to countries teeming with foreign correspondents and photographers? What would be gained or, indeed, lost, from such a shift?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think it’s important to have both and I do notice there has been a shift in the past couple of years towards trying to get coverage from both local and foreign perspectives – not enough yet, but there is a certain shift.</p>
<p>The local perspective has a sense of authenticity and pure knowledge – it’s not even knowledge, but it’s simply an understanding of one’s own culture and traditions, so subtleties such as body language and gestures are understood, not overlooked.</p>
<p>This makes a huge difference in telling a story and in communicating with people on the ground. At the other extreme, sometimes a local perspective can be too close and that’s when it’s really important to have an outsider’s point of view.</p>
<p>What I don’t like is when you have foreigners reporting in a country and beginning to look down on the locals and think they know more about the country than people who are from there. I think such a presumptuous attitude is certain to filter into their storytelling, and it taints their coverage.</p>

<p>We talked about covert diplomacy, individual responsibility and the importance of playing cards with Mr. Ollivier, Carlos Agullo, the film’s director, and Mandy Jacobson, its producer.*</p>
<p>Replete with secret meetings, tense moments and a lot of backdoor diplomacy, “Plot for Peace” has all the right elements to make a good thriller. In fact, I’m sure somewhere in Hollywood they’re casting for potential Mr. Olliviers right now. An important part of this story is the historic prisoner exchange which took place on Sept. 7 1987, between South Africa and Mozambique, involving 133 Angolan soldiers and several South African prisoners. Bringing together great footage with great interviews from key political figures of the time, “Plot for Peace” tells an interesting, little-known story, which can definitely shed a bit more light on the complexity of South African politics of the late 80’s.</p>
<p><strong>SOAS SPIRIT (SS): How did you come about this project? It seems like the best kept secret in the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mandy Jacobson (MJ):</strong> It’s certainly a long kept secret. I have the privilege of working for a foundation project called African Oral History Archive and our mandate is to preserve the stories of people who‘ve made a difference on the continent. </p>
<p>Obviously we started in South Africa, where we’re based, and through that process of interviewing […] a lot of different role players, we also searched visual archive sources from different news media. </p>
<p>Through [this] we discovered this clip about a prisoner exchange that had happened in the late 80s and the voiceover said “Monsieur Jacques was given an award for his contribution in the prisoner exchange”, and that prisoner exchange had certainly kept in the South African imagination; and then we discovered that the same Monsieur Jacques had been awarded an Order of Merit from president Nelson Mandela. </p>
<p>So that was the start of the story, to then track down the mysterious businessman and to try and convince him to tell his story.</p>
<p><strong>SS: Mr. Ollivier, you’ve brought such a contribution to the history of South Africa, and it’s been kept out of the public sphere up to now. Did you intend that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jean-Yves Ollivier (JYO):</strong> Oh definitely, I never thought that I would ever have to sit in front of you, to talk about that, and to prove it. I never took pictures, never made notes, because it was past and I was more interested in what would happen tomorrow than what happened yesterday. It was circumstance which has me talking, and of course the charm of Mandy [Jacobson] and Carlos [Agullo] had a big role in that. But the world has changed. </p>
<p>I was living in a world where Google didn’t exist, there was no fax, there was no Internet; so you could enjoy the privilege to be anonymous and to live your own life without attracting the attention of others. Impossible today. And if you don’t tell your side of the story, you are opening the door for a misinterpretation of your actions, so it was time to talk. And also I have the duty towards the people who were my companions, my “plotters”. </p>
<p>A lot of them were pushing me to tell the story, saying: “Jean-Yves, you are the only one who can, we are only parts of the story”, and “Why do you deny me the possibility to be known for what I have done?” So that also played a role. Also, the “plotters” were getting old. Some of them have gone. One of my big regrets is that if we would have started two, three years before, we would have had Mr. Mandela, I have no doubt about it. A little bit [presumptuous] perhaps, but I don’t doubt it. So I think the time had come.</p>
<p><strong>SS: Is it important that it’s been told?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> It’s very difficult for me to appreciate how important it is. If I look at the audience when I’m at the Q&amp;A, it looks like they are happy to have been able to know the story. […] It’s up to you to decide whether it’s important or not, you are the young part of my audience.</p>
<p><strong>MJ:</strong> History has many mothers and fathers, so the more we can talk about different people and events, but mostly people who made a difference, the more we learn about history, because we really haven’t learned that much from history if you look at the terrifying state of conflicts around the world. Here I am as a South African who didn’t know, didn’t even think or was schooled or educated to think about the contribution of regional diplomacy. We knew that the frontline states were housing victims of Apartheid, but we didn’t know about curious behind-the-scenes diplomacy that was helping people shift form ideological dogma. So I think there are a lot of very good reasons why these stories need to be told.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Agullo (CA):</strong> I think, when you tell a story about a certain period of time, an event or an individual, at the end, if it’s a human story, it becomes universal, and for younger audiences it becomes essential to understand that they have to do something and that an individual can do something. Obviously, not everyone can be in touch with presidents or get on a plane and zigzag the continent for nine months, but that doesn’t mean that your actions are less needed, less valuable. Each one has to find his way of helping, his way of taking part in the society, in the political life of a society and I think that’s very important to convey to young people who still don’t understand what their role is. They sometimes click ‘I like this cause’ or ‘I don’t like this cause’, but how do they participate in the society? I think it’s very inspirational.</p>
<p><strong>SS: There’s a quote in the movie on how Africa is still a place where one individual can still have great influence. Is that a vulnerability, is it dangerous?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> I cannot imagine that every individual will try to change things for the bad. Or that an individual will act negatively, unless he’s the devil himself. Human nature is positive and when an individual decides to do something, it’s always for better things, so where is the danger?</p>
<p><strong>SS: I think not everyone has good intentions and that once you have a lot of power, you can easily be corrupted by that power. For example, there are many African countries with leaders in power for twenty years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> And what’s wrong with that? If they are good for the country and they are democratically elected?</p>
<p><strong>SS: Some would say they aren’t democratically elected.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> It’s a matter of argument. If there are elections, and you know, now you cannot have an 
election in Africa unless you have neutral observers. If those observers are given free access to an election, on what right can someone say that an election is not democratic? There is a tendency today to believe that in Africa, the only aim is corruption and dictatorship, but it doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p><strong>CA:</strong> Many times I think it’s used as a pretext to intervene.</p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> And to impose your own view. Let the Africans decide their own view. […] Aren’t we, by criticizing automatically what’s happening in Africa, are we not trying to interfere with something which is not our issue? It is time that the world stops to have only one aim, which is to replace the bad by the worst. It’s exactly what’s happening in the world right now.</p>
<p><strong>MJ:</strong> It’s a wonderfully complex question, because the tyranny of the individual and the tyranny of the masses can end up being one and the same, and for me, what was really interesting about this story was that, yes it was an individual, it was Jean-Yves Ollivier, zigzagging across, but without the plot, without the people he was interacting with, he would never have succeeded. </p>
<p>And even in South Africa, you join an anti-Apartheid movement, you do something different to try and make your world a better place, but it’s never just alone, it’s never just in that extreme ethic of one person and nothing else matters. And “Plot for Peace” is a beautiful example of how together, that alchemy makes a difference.</p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> This is the message that I would like to reinforce – I was never alone. I was always with my friends.</p>
<p><strong>SS: Nelson Mandela’s absence in the movie is conspicuous. Was that intended?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CA:</strong>  To relate to the thriller feeling in a movie, you need to feel the main characters’ difficulties in his journey. To feel his difficulty you must be close to him and you must see the world as he saw it at that moment. As a non-South African, […] I didn’t even know, and I was very surprised that the image that we have of Mandela, when he came out of jail – that was the first time that people saw Mandela in 27 years. And the image that people were using in the Free Mandela Movement – that was the last picture of him taken before he was imprisoned. […] He had never been seen in public in 27 years. And that was really shocking for me. That’s why in the movie I think it’s good that while people are plotting and trying to liberate Mandela, you don’t ever see Mandela, because that’s the way it was. Nobody ever saw Mandela.</p>
<p><strong>SS: Mr. Ollivier, you were born in Algeria. How has that influenced your view and your experience of the African continent?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> Definitely, we all come with our background, our stories, our family and that will influence you. It’s a part of your life, whether you like it or not. The fact that I was born in Algeria gave me at least the feeling that … to see what I have seen and to live what I have lived, that we are heading for disaster. It will be the victory of one, because the other one will have been destroyed. Yesterday, in the Q&amp;A, one South African journalist wanted to say that the bad things were [only done] by the whites. No, no, there were also bad things done by the blacks, and that’s why Mandela had this extraordinary idea of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. […] There were bad things [done] on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>MJ:</strong> I think that what will always stand out for me was the line in the film where Jean-Yves says that: “I came to realize that I myself could be the other in different circumstances.” And if we really unpack that, it has profound implications on the way we think about conflicts today.</p>
<p><strong>SS: The movie focuses a lot on the impact of covert diplomacy versus overt one. Why was covert diplomacy so necessary then?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> Just for one reason. There were sanctions and I’m not ashamed to say that I was a sanctions booster because the sanctions bar any possibility of dialogue. It was not permitted to talk to those white people in Pretoria. Our French ambassador […] was in Pretoria and nobody was ever passing the door of the embassy because he was not allowed to talk to people. So what I did was to reopen channels of dialogue and by [doing] that I was bound to secrecy, because everybody would have been saying that I was [bypassing] the sanctions. I would have been condemned. </p>
<p>The president [of the Republic of Congo]  [Denis] Sassou-Nguesso was a Marxist Leninist. If it would have been known that he sent his minister of Foreign Affairs to this racist regime, what interpretations would the party have given to him? He would have been put in jail, he would have been excluded. He put his power at risk to follow me, so I had a duty to protect also those people who were doing things secretly, and to do it under cover.</p>
<p><strong>SS: Is there still a need for covert diplomacy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> Yes, definitely. But don’t ask me to do it! Let’s take a very simple example. We have a hostage situation in Syria, especially with journalists, and not only French ones. The only way to get them out is though unofficial diplomacy; it cannot be an official diplomat. Someone has to go there secretly, accepted by the official party, so there is a need for this type of negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>CA:</strong> The official diplomacy is so much about ideological dogma, but most times there are economic issues involved and because these mediators are many times businessmen, it makes it easier to go down to that level, without the recorder, and to talk broadly about what the real interests of the conflict are.</p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> And the trust. The official diplomacy requests documents and signatures and stamps. I don’t need that, I don’t have one document signed. In the prisoner exchange, [there were] six countries [involved] and someone said: “Ok, on the 7th of September, you go to Maputo [capital of Mozambique], you bring your plane, your prisoners, and you go back with your own prisoners, in the middle of the war.” And there was not one document signed, not one.</p>
<p><strong>CA:</strong>  In the end, if the official sides don’t agree, you’ve done nothing. And I think for all these politicians and diplomats to engage with non-official people, it’s always a risk. […] They need to know that this person does not want to take the credit. If the thing doesn’t succeed, nobody will know; if it works well, they, as politicians, will take the credit. It’s essential that this is done undercover, to be able to achieve efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>SS: There is a juxtaposition in the documentary of horrible violence, perpetrated by all, against all, with clean-cut images mostly of white men in a neutral background, which gives the impression of far removed leaders. Is that intended?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CA:</strong> There is a coldness to how the violence is treated in the film, no going down to the ground level, to the soldiers and getting to the emotional side of the people who were dying in the field; and I think that gives you a good feeling of how it would be like in a negotiation [setting].</p>
<p><strong>JYO:</strong> A little anecdote. Mandela is about to meet ‘the Old Crocodile’ [P.W. Botha, South Africa’s president 1978-1989], the first image of Mandela after 27 years, his first photograph. Do you know what the only condition he put was? He asked for a good tailor, that was Mr Seti, and he asked for a custom-made suit, tie, white shirt. Because he didn’t want to be seen by the world as a convict, but as a dignified man, as a leader. And he kept on wearing ties for a long time, he started to move to what people call the Mandela shirt after he left power.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Cinema is London’s oldest continuously running cinemas – it opened in 1912 as the East Finchley Picturedome and although the name’s changed several times, the building has kept its Art Deco magnificence. </p>
<p>The screening room has retained its original barrel ceiling, and Art Deco friezes were added in the 30’s, all perfectly preserved today. Although the entrance hall reminds one of better days, the cafe upstairs is a nice surprise, selling anything your heart desires at more than reasonable prices – and it’s all free to take inside. All in all, it’s a charming place, which could probably use a bit of a spruce-up, but with student ticket prices starting at £6, we’re definitely sold. </p>
<p>“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a cooky affair, a frenzied combination of Agatha Christie whodunit, complete with extravagant décor and eccentric characters, and “Grand Hotel” remake, with everyone potentially high on LSD, director Wes Anderson included. </p>
<p>“The Grand Budapest...” bears Anderson’s signatory mark and gathers round all his fetish-actors, Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton and Tilda Swinton (whose transformation into an 82-year old is amazingly fun and unfortunately not given enough screen-time). Together with Ralph Fiennes, Jude Law and Harvey Keitel (the list goes on, and on...) they make up quite the Hollywood-crowd.</p>
<p>Then again, that’s precisely what the Grand Budapest hotel is about, its extraordinary guests and staff, all either fabulously rich or fabulously quirky, and ruled over by the gentlemanly, energetic, no-nonsense M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). </p>
<p>When one of the hotel’s most celebrated guests, dowager countess Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) unexpectedly dies of strychnine poisoning, M.Gustave gets blamed for her murder, for they were not only lovers (at 82, she was apparently “fantastic in bed”), but he is one of the heirs in her will. Family feud ensues as her sons, Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and Jopling (Willem Dafoe) contest the will and M. Gustave is forced to flee.</p>
<p>All this takes place in the backdrop of the Grand Budapest, in the republic of Zubrowka (no, you can’t find it on the map), in between the two world wars. The changes that World War II will bring are already being felt, the most permeating of which is a sense of an ending – indeed, we first discover the hotel as a shadow of its old past, an image that preempts the fate of its inhabitants. </p>
<p>Throughout the movie, M. Gustave’s elegant mannerisms are the focus of attention, as a reminder that men like him, and indeed, that whole world, no longer exist. In that regard, it’s a good thing that Zubrowka is an imaginary country, for only there could one still find an enclave of this glorified past.</p>
<p>That being said, this is also a very fun movie, a crazy colours parade, with secret romances and secret wills, a lot of running around and many absurd moments delivered in the best matter-of-fact way. </p>
<p>A carnival of the absurd, if you will, a fantasy created as an antidote to the realities of the fascist and communist regimes which the movie hints at, especially through the reference to novelist Stefan Zweig, whose writings inspired the script. He famously committed suicide due to the ravages the war had inflicted on that old world, the old Europe he had tried to preserve in his books and it is that same world which “The Grand Budapest Hotel” wants to take us to, albeit with a touch of flamboyance.</p>

<p>Set in the Greenwich Village folk music scene of the 60s, the Coen brothers’ new movie, “Inside Llewyn Davis”, takes a look at the life of folk singer Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) and his attempts to go from being on-the-brink to getting a big break. </p>
<p>Davis’ life takes the rhythm of days blindly following each other as he struggles to make it in an industry known for its ruthlessness, and while he has the talent, the folk scene is getting more crowded by the day. The uncertainties of the future bring a strain to his relationships as well, which are fraught with fights and constant dissatisfaction – the only constancy he shows is towards an orange cat he happens to get stuck with, arguably the most colourful character of the movie.</p>
<p>His relationship with Jean, another folk singer (played by a wonderful, lively, foul-mouthed Carey Mulligan such as we haven’t seen before), is the only dynamic part of a movie that is otherwise poignantly still, punctuated by a succession of bleak road trips, psychedelic-like moments and a restlessness for a successful future which never does materialize. </p>
<p>In between all the mess that is his life, there’s the music, the haunting Mississippi-like blues, opening and closing the film like a soundtrack of pain. The music also has a redemptive quality here, saving Llewyn from himself and bringing raw emotion onto the screen; when not singing, he appears almost absent from his own life, taking each hit with comedic ambivalence, oscillating between drunken fights with everyone around him, or walking away from everything and entertaining the thought of a career at sea on a merchant ship.</p>
<p>With long-cut scenes and a palette that covers all the greys in existence, the movie plays the bleakness of the landscape against a host of humorous moments which serve as ironic, painful reminders of life’s absurdity. In Llewyn’s world, a lifetime of ironies come together to deliver the biggest one of all – the moment any musician is hoping for, the big audition, takes place twice and is unsuccessful both times, like a repeat of the same grainy, broken record. </p>
<p>Still, Llewyn’s life is also a making of his own, and not simply the result of sheer bad luck. His misplaced anger puts him into tricky situations, his arrogance has a way of keeping him there and while his music is great, it’s not enough.</p>
<p>“Inside Llewyn Davis” assumes a peek inside the main character’s mind, but continuing the irony, keeps us out of the loop. We know this is a guy who does nothing to be likeable to anyone around him, and he gets our attention through his no-nonsense, harried attitude, but we never get through to him. </p>
<p>This comes across well in Oscar Isaac’s acting, as his outbursts of anger give way to an interior stillness, beautifully captured on screen by the Coen brothers. While the movie is loosely based on the life of folk singer Dave Van Ronk, it distinctly manages to make it all about Llewyn Davis. It is a sad, melancholy affair, but an entertaining one.</p>

The SOAS Spirit takes a look and leaves mesmerized.</em></p>
<p>“Only Lovers Left Alive” is a deliciously macabre movie, complete with gothic overtones and psychedelic music. It is the story of two vampires, Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton), who are forced to go back to the primeval method of attacking people for blood (‘How very 15th century,’ thinks Eve) when their suppliers disappear. At least, that’s one way of telling it. </p>
<p>Alternatively, this is the story of a happily married couple (for close to four centuries, we might add), whose life gets turned upside down when Eva’s troublesome little sister, Ava (Mia Wasikowska) comes to call. Because even vampires have family trouble, suffer from depression, travel first class and own iPhones.</p>
<p>This couple’s usual life takes place at night-time – luminous, full-of-promise nights, filled with music, love-making and the occasional blood-sipping, as well as a lot of reminiscing about the yesterdays of hanging out with the likes of Poe, Shelley and Byron (‘a pompous ass’, according to Adam). 
The true gist of their problem is the one most common to mortals and immortals alike, the passing of time, with all the implications that has for self-preservation. The movie is replete with primordial undertones, starting with the names of its protagonists, a clear allusion to the biblical Adam and Eve. </p>
<p>Their paradise is their home, set in a Detroit that is crumbling around them, a decaying city on the edge of extinction, exactly as they are, and everything brought to this point by the human race (‘zombies’, they call us), which as always, understands everything only when it’s too late.</p>
<p>The peril of death draws closer than comfortable when their friend and fellow vampire Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt), the playwright supposedly murdered in the 15th century, falls fatally ill. At the same time, Eve’s sister, Ava, acts as another symbol of impending doom, coming to further disturb their fragile, if glamorous, livelihood. </p>
<p>Appearing at times as a catastrophe in the making, at others as petulant child, Ava triggers the couple’s departure to Tangiers, Morocco, a mysterious, noise-infused town, whose winding alleys and dark corners are seemingly made for them.</p>
<p>“Only Lovers Left Alive” is sublimely weird, with a hypnotic feeling running throughout it, seeping into the imagery, the houses the couple inhabit, the music that binds everything together. The two live in an overdose of senses, surrounding themselves with history in the form of ancient musical instruments, keeping everyone and everything away in an attempt to maintain their paradise intact. </p>
<p>Theirs is a story of courtly love, of decadence and decay, with a house in tatters which guards inside it a history of the world. The fall from Paradise occurs as they are forced to embark on killing again in order to survive, but we get the feeling that that won’t prove to be such an insurmountable obstacle.</p>
<p>Director and screenwriter Jim Jarmusch does a great job in creating an atmosphere of eerie glamour rather than outright fear, taking this more as a melancholy love story, where the lovers happen to be vampires – and it works, too. Swinton and Hiddleston bring forth a gothic lusciousness to the screen, taking over our sense of right and wrong, making us actively root for them. </p>
<p>They are, by far, the most loveable vampire couple out there, whose levels of cool outstretch far beyond anything the “Twilight” series could inspire.</p>
<p>Bonus point: a live, dream-like musical performance by Lebanese singer Yasmine Hamdan.</p>

We do not recommend!</em></p>
<p>This is the worst movie I have ever seen. To make matters worse, however, Empire Cinema is also probably the worst cinema I’ve ever been in ‑ and this coming from someone who’s seen movies in old, dilapidated, Communist-era cinemas, back in 90s Romania. Let me tell you, this doesn’t even come close. </p>
<p>On a Friday night, when Leicester Square becomes one big moving crowd, Empire Cinema is mostly deserted. The better word for it, however, is seedy. The carpets, sofas, people, everything looks like poorly mismatched props from a B-movie,  dumped unceremoniously in a central London building. </p>
<p>The prices, on the other hand, do very much belong in central London – between £9.95 and £11.95 for a student ticket, and £6.50 for a vat of popcorn. To round up the picture, you have the obligatory half-hour of ads before each screening and tourists loudly talking throughout the movie. Then again, maybe it was all a clever stunt designed to prepare us for ‘The Counselor’ – another seedy, over-hyped, crazy experience.</p>
<p>This movie creates such high expectations through its high-credit cast and director (Ridley Scott) that you spend half of it hoping against hope that maybe there’s something to it, and the other half embracing its ridiculousness and laughing your head off. The room was in stitches for some of its most cringing moments and as far as I could tell, experienced no other emotions whatsoever – just like the characters on screen, although they were trying. </p>
<p>Essentially, this is a movie about a drug deal gone bad, which starts in Juarez, Mexico, and ends  in London’s financial district. There are two things driving the action: sex and money, dirty, filthy rich money, and one feels a lot of nastiness hiding between the gritty worlds the characters inhabit. </p>
<p>You have the classic money-cars-sex-gruesome murders axis, plus a couple of cheetahs thrown in for good fun. You have two show-stopping leading ladies, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz, and three leading men, Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender and Javier Bardem. You’d think that’s a foolproof recipe, right? Well, you’d be wrong.</p>
<p>While the cast is great and the film editing done beautifully, the script, by writer/screenwriter Cormac McCarthy, sadly makes you cringe, line after line, with underdeveloped and stereotypical characters (the drug lord, the slut, the counselor, the fixer, the ingénue), and the actual plot of the movie is very hard to follow – I left the cinema knowing the basics, sure, but there are still scenes which completely elude me. </p>
<p>The acting was over the top, trying to give some depth to a script that was, essentially, full of clichés and sexist beyond belief. The ‘best’ scene? Cameron Diaz dry-humping a windshield. And yes, that’s exactly what you think it is. Not only was it a pointless, sexist, gratuitous scene, it was also unbelievably, ridiculously crazy – the kind that could easily win ‘Worst scene of the year’ … every year!</p>
<p>Ultimately, ‘The Counselor’ falls into the trap of trying to be too many things at once – drama and action movie combo, all packed in with a great cast. It shows too much with not enough room, with scenes which seem disconnected from each other, and the audience doesn’t have enough time to relate to the characters in order to get either the thrills of an action movie, or the empathy of a drama – and so the movie fails at both.  </p>

Correction – it’s hard to make a good movie. Director Kathryn Bigelow, who won an Oscar for her previous movie, ‘The Hurt Locker’, attempted just that with ‘Zero Dark Thirty’, which covers the years and hours leading up to the capture and kill of Osama Bin Laden. That’s a subject that was bound to draw people to the cinema, out of sheer curiosity if not patriotism.</p>
<p>So, in pouring rain, we made our way to the Renoir Curzon cinema in the Brunswick Centre, a short walk away from SOAS. With an elegant Art Deco feel to it, the Renoir makes one think of different times, when cinemas were exciting and packed, the ladies always stylish, and the popcorn much less than 5 pounds, for if there’s a downside to this fancy establishment, it’s the steep prices and the lack of student discounts.
On the other hand, with two cinema theatres, the Renoir offers something for all tastes, mainstream and out-of-the-ordinary alike. On a rainy Monday night however, the cinema was quite empty, so we had our pick of seats, and sat down for what proved to be a very long three hours.</p>
<p>Zero Dark Thirty is a movie about America’s loss of innocence. It focuses on Maya (Jessica Chastain), a CIA agent sent to Pakistan to train as an interrogator in the (in)famous US detainee camps (pre-Abu Ghraib scandal).</p>
<p>Throughout the movie, we see her change from a soft-spoken, pale-skinned, red-haired epitome of delicacy to a tough-skinned, foul-mouthed, no-nonsense motherfucker. This transformation happens against the backdrop of the post 9/11 hunt for Bin Laden and the intensification of al-Qaida’s violent presence in the world.</p>
<p>The other main character is, of course, Osama bin Laden, every American’s Bogeyman, who permeates the actions and fears of all; every violent scene, from the torture of prisoners by the Americans to the many suicide bombings shown are meant to drive home just how necessary Osama’s death is.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to call this movie a tear-jerker, but it’s definitely a sympathy-jerker; after all, when your story eventually builds up to killing a man, you need to have a good reason for it, and a sympathetic audience.</p>
<p>Throughout the movie, even if there are moments where it looks like America’s actions might be criticized (seeing President Obama halfway through talking about how America doesn’t torture prisoners is priceless), you still get a sense of the need for justification, of an implied ‘necessary evil’, that is supposed to bring viewers and American society alike to believe that in the end, his death was worth it.</p>
<p>What the movie also does, perhaps inadvertently, is show how glorified this death was, like it could ever somehow compensate for the thousands who died because of al-Qaida, US citizens and Afghanis alike. “So, where do you want to go to now?” is the last sentence of the movie, addressed to Maya as much as to the States.</p>
<p>ZD30 has generated a lot of controversy, not least because of how it portrays this already-loaded subject, and the Oscar nomination Jessica Chastain received for her portrayal of Maya has done nothing but add fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>Although too long, it’s definitely a movie one should see to better understand how the mainstream narrative of al-Qaida functions in the American conscience.</p>
