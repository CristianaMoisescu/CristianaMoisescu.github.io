Seeing them immediately evokes the richness of her paintings, while poignantly offering an insight into her life. This is the effect of the Ishiuchi Miyako: Frida exhibition at Michael Hoppen Gallery, which collect’s Miyako photography of Kahlo’s wardrobe and belongings.</p>
<p>Until recently, most of these personal items were locked up in the dark, in a room in the ‘Casa Azul’, Frida’s house-turned-museum in Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. Her husband, painter Diego Rivera, had them stored there, to be presented to the public 15 years after his death. In fact, the room was only opened in 2004, uncovering aspects of Frida no album had catalogued so far (who knew she liked Revlon nail polish, in a deep, fiery pink, the name of which was ‘Orchid to you’?)</p>
<p>Japanese artist Ishiuchi Miyako was invited to photograph the items, which numbered over 300. Of these, only a handful are on display here, carefully arranged to paint the most subtle of portraits: there are hints at her illness, a testimony of her insatiable drive to create, her dark femininity.</p>
<p>The photos themselves seem to float in mid-air, echoing a dream-like Frida, who only exists in our imagination. What the real woman would have made of her personal memorabilia being showcased for everyone to see is hard to guess. These days, anything Frida elicits a strong response – her love letters to Spanish artist Jose Bartoli were auctioned off in April for $137,000 – and this glimpse into her private life is no exception.</p>
<p>Still, the viewer here is prevented from getting too close: the photographs are ethereal, hypnotic and the effect is hard to associate with the smells and texture of clothing. Reality is held at bay, with long, black gloves stretching out into the whiteness around, far from inviting. When would she have worn them? Does it really matter? A corset with skirt attached seems to be echoing a Soviet astronaut’s gear – only a closer look reveals her hand and drawings on the hard plaster.</p>
<p>There are also hints of glamorous Frida, with cat-like sunglasses and a turquoise bathing suit – is there a Hollywood star beneath the paint dirt? Then there is the artist at work – in this case, hand-stitching skirts, decorating a fake boot to make it hers, dispersing her creative energy into her clothes, which have become extensions of herself.</p>
<p>All in all, Miyako’s photographs encapsulate different versions of this mythical woman, while keeping the real one at bay, free from curious looks intruding. In a way, it’s as if that locked room was never opened.</p>
<p>Ishiuchi Miyako: Frida runs at the Michael Hoppen gallery until 12 July 2015.</p>

href="/articles/zero-dark-thirty"><h4 class="card-title cm-article-card--title">Zero Dark Thirty</h4></a><p>It’s hard to make a movie to which everyone knows the ending. Correction – it’s hard to make a good movie. Director Kathryn Bigelow, who won an Oscar for her previous movie, ‘The Hurt Locker’, attempted just that with ‘Zero Dark Thirty’, which covers the years and hours leading up to the capture and kill of Osama Bin Laden. A subject that was bound to draw people to the cinema, out of sheer curiosity if not patriotism.</p>
<p>So, in pouring rain, we made our way to the Renoir Curzon cinema in the Brunswick Centre, a short walk away from SOAS. With an elegant Art Deco feel to it, the Renoir makes one think of different times, when cinemas were exciting and packed, the ladies always stylish, and the popcorn much less than 5 pounds (i don’t have the pound sign on my laptop, sorry),for if there’s a downside to this fancy establishment, it’s the steep prices and the lack of student discounts. On the other hand, with two cinema theatres, the Renoir offers something for all tastes, mainstream and out of the ordinary alike. On a rainy Monday night however, the cinema was quite empty, so we had our pick of seats, and sat down for what proved to be a very long three hours.</p>
<p>Zero Dark Thirty is a movie about America’s loss of innocence, or at least, that’s what it’s made to look like. It focuses on Maya (Jessica Chastain), a CIA agent sent to Pakistan to train as an interrogator in the (in)famous US detainee camps (pre-Abu Ghraib scandal). Throughout the movie, we see her change from a soft-spoken, pale-skinned, red-haired epitome of delicacy to a tough-skinned, foul-mouthed, no-nonsense motherfucker. This transformation happens against the backdrop of the post 9/11 hunt for Bin Laden and the intensification of al-Qaida’s violent presence in the world. The other main character is, of course, Osama bin Laden, every American’s Bogeyman, who permeates the actions and fears of all; every violent scene, from the torture of prisoners by the Americans to the many suicide bombings shown are meant to drive home just how necessary Osama’s death is.
It would be wrong to call this movie a tear-jerker, but it’s definitely a sympathy-jerker; after all, when your story eventually builds up to killing a man, you need to have a good reason for it, and a sympathetic audience. Throughout the movie, even if there are moments where it looks like America’s actions might be criticized (seeing President Obama halfway through talking about how America doesn’t torture prisoners is priceless), you still get a sense of the need for justification, of an implied ‘necessary evil’, that is supposed to bring viewers and American society alike to believe that in the end, his death was worth it; what the movie also does, perhaps inadvertently, is show how glorified this death was, like it could ever somehow compensate for the thousands who died because of al-Qaida. “So, where do you want to go to now” is the last sentence of the movie, addressed to Maya as much as to America.</p>
<p>ZD30 has generated a lot of controversy, not least because of how it portrays this already-loaded subject, and the Oscar nomination Jessica Chastain received for her portrayal of Maya has done nothing but add fuel to the fire. Although too long, it’s definitely a movie one should see to better understand how the mainstream narrative of al-Qaida functions in the American conscience. </p>
<p>Zero Dark Thirty plays at the Renoir Curzon cinema until the 7th of February, with three showings a day.</p>
