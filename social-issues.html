<p>Phil Sayer, a voice-over artist who recorded warnings for several London Underground lines, as well as for adverts, died on Thursday according to statements on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sorry to announce that this service terminates here,&quot; his wife Elinor Hamilton said in the statement.</p>
<p>Hamilton described Sayer as a &quot;voice of reason, radio, and railways&quot; and &quot;a dearly loved husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend.&quot;</p>
<p>Sayer was a BBC regional TV and radio presenter in the 1980s, before setting up a voice-over business with his wife.</p>
<p>Phil Sayer provided the voiceover for the &quot;Mind the gap&quot; announcement on the Tube.</p>
<p>In 2014, he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, for which he underwent surgery and chemotherapy. A year later, the illness seemed to have abated.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is diagnosed too late, then surgery is no longer an option. Mine seems to have been caught just in time,&quot; Sayer told his local newspaper, the Bolton News, last year, while preparing to take part in the Great Manchester Run. &quot;It&#39;s great to be here a year down the line with every confidence I&#39;ve still got a future.&quot;</p>
<p>But in early April this year he retired, citing health concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to a sudden and unexpected decline in Phil&#39;s health, Sayer Hamilton Ltd is temporarily closing for business with immediate effect, and Phil will not be returning to work,&quot; read a statement on his company&#39;s website.</p>

<p><strong>You’ve been a prominent activist for human rights since the late 1960s – what keeps you going?</strong></p>
<p>I love other people and love justice, equality and freedom. These ideals, and my natural optimism, sustain me. Despite some setbacks, the trajectory of history is to triumph over oppression. There are many campaigns that I’ve been involved with where our collective action has won great victories, such as the movements against apartheid in South Africa, the US war in Vietnam and against communist tyranny in the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>Plus, I’ve had the joy of assisting thousands of victims of human rights abuses to secure redress. It has often been hard, exhausting work, but these successes energize and inspire me to keep going. The positive feedback I get from people I’ve helped and worked with is also a great motivator.</p>
<p><strong>What were your early inspirations?</strong></p>
<p>As a teenager growing up in the 1960s, I was inspired by the courage and defiance of the black civil rights movement in the US – especially by Martin Luther King and the freedom riders. I embraced their tactics of nonviolent direct action and civil disobedience as a means to secure political change.</p>
<p>Other inspirations include Mohandas Gandhi and Sylvia Pankhurst. I adapted some of their ideas and protest methods to my own contemporary struggle for human rights – and invented a few of my own.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like growing up in a conservative family?</strong></p>
<p>My family were working-class conservatives bordering on Christian fundamentalists, very similar to the family depicted by Jeanette Winterson in her book, <em>Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit</em>. Life revolved around the family and the church.</p>
<p>My parents had no social conscience or interest in politics. They did not approve of my teenage activism. My stepfather would quote St Paul: the powers that be are ordained by God. I retorted: What, even Hitler and Stalin? I got a beating for answering back. But after about 30 years, my parents began to understand and respect my work.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about the upcoming British elections?</strong></p>
<p>The general election will be a farce because of the unfair, anti-democratic voting system. First-past-the-post worked fine when there were only two parties. But it’s unfit for purpose when we have five-plus significant parties.</p>
<p>The next parliament, like its predecessors, will not be representative of all voters. Millions of people who vote for smaller parties like the Greens will get few MPs. From 1955-2005, not a single British government won a majority of the popular vote. In 2005, Labour won 35 per cent of the vote but bagged 55 per cent of the seats. That’s not democratic. We need a form of proportional representation like they have in the Scottish elections – and a new Chartist-style movement to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest struggle for human rights at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>There are many huge challenges: to end global poverty and stop climate destruction. To empower women and girls, who represent half of humanity and are the single largest oppressed 
social group on the planet.</p>
<p>To support Muslims worldwide, who are the victims of Islamist extremism. And to defend civil
liberties that are under attack in the name of defending democracy against terrorism. You don’t defend freedom by undermining it.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think so many are still against LGBTI people?</strong></p>
<p>Organized religion is the major global force against LGBTI equality. It pushes homophobic values and laws that discriminate against LGBTI people. I find this odd.</p>
<p>Love and compassion are at the heart of most faiths, yet when it comes to matters of sexuality, most religious leaders promote prejudice and discrimination. They cherry-pick and distort relatively minor bits of holy text to justify their bigotry.</p>
<p>Another factor is the scapegoating mob mentality. Many people seem to need a minority to despise, to make them feel superior and to blame for the ills they suffer. The rejection of ‘the other’ and their persecution as ‘the enemy within’ recurs a lot throughout history.</p>
<p>Minority races, faiths, ethnicities and sexualities have all been victims. Leaders such as [Vladimir] Putin in Russia and [Yoweri] Museveni in Uganda are cynically colluding with the demonization of the LGBTI community as a way of distracting public attention from their government’s failings.</p>
<p><strong>What are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<p>The two attempted citizen’s arrests of the Zimbabwean tyrant Robert Mugabe. I did not succeed, but they helped raise public awareness about his human rights abuses.</p>
<p><strong>The work you do requires a lot of time and energy, and you’ve had your share of unpleasantness along the way. Do you ever feel lonely?</strong></p>
<p>I am too busy to get lonely. My many campaigns involve working with lots of interesting, kind-hearted people. I tend to work 14 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and have not had a holiday for seven years. I live with never-ending hate mails and death threats from human rights abusers and their allies. It’s a tough life but a rewarding one. Thankfully, I have wonderful, supportive friends.</p>
<p><strong>When were you most afraid?</strong></p>
<p>In Brussels in 2001, when I was beaten unconscious by President Mugabe’s minders as I tried to make a citizen’s arrest on charges of torture. And again in Moscow in 2007, when I was bashed by neo-Nazis while supporting the bid by Russian LGBTI activists to hold a Gay Pride march. Both times, I thought I was going to be killed. Luckily, I escaped with just some minor brain and eye damage.</p>
<p><strong>Who would you like to banish from the planet?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to banish anyone. But I would like to banish prejudice, inequality, war, and poverty. I’d prefer human rights abusers to see the wrong they are doing and become human rights defenders. I believe in redemption and forgiveness.</p>

<p>When police officer Darren Wilson drew out his gun on the afternoon of 9 August, took aim and shot six bullets into Michael Brown, he had no idea it would trigger a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28863057">riot</a> on the very streets he’d been watching over.</p>
<p>After all, who was Michael Brown? Just another black 18-year-old. More importantly, who did Darren Wilson see when he pulled the trigger? A gentle giant, as his family have called him? A potential troublemaker, a thief? A soon-to-be college undergrad? A national statistic?</p>
<p>And later, when Michael Brown lay dead on that hot Ferguson street for more than four hours, for everyone to see, who was he then? An unfortunate victim of an accident, someone in the wrong place at the wrong time? A mistake? Another lynched black man?</p>
<p>Michael Brown, the person, was many things, most of which the media is only now beginning to piece together, and some of which will largely remain unknown. Michael Brown, the trigger for a protest, is another, altogether more complicated story, which begins in a small town in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Ferguson is a suburban belt of St Louis, Missouri. It’s a town of 21,000, with one of the highest levels of <a href="http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report2.pdf">segregation</a> in the US, where white flight has been a steady <a href="http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/segregation2010/city.aspx?cityid=2923986">phenomenon</a> since the 1980s, and where 69 per cent of the population is black. The town’s institutions don’t reflect this, however, especially the police force, where out of 53 police officers, only three are black.</p>
<p>Numbers are important. They tell a story of their own, one with fixed parameters, which can shine a light on an otherwise muddled tale. For example, while many might suspect that black people are more prone to a stop-and-search, statistics prove it: in Ferguson, they are 1.3 times <a href="http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/Reports.php?lea=161">more likely</a> to be stopped by the police than their white neighbours.</p>
<p>From ‘2006 to 2012, a white police officer <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/melissa_harris_perry_delivers_an_impassioned_tribute_to_unarmed_black_me_killed_by_police/">killed</a> a black person at least <a href="http://www.rolereboot.org/culture-and-politics/details/2014-08-black-unarmed-women-girls-without-weapons-killed-law-enforcement/">twice</a> a week’ in the US. That amounts to more than <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/">400</a> dead. In Ferguson, just 11 days after Michael Brown’s shooting, another young black man was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kajieme-powell-shooting-missouri-police-release-video-footage-of-second-man-killed-by-officers-9682357.html?origin=internalSearch">killed</a> by the police.</p>
<p>Institutionalized racism is not a new phenomenon. The slow depletion of young black men and women from their communities is also not news. Still, something about the death of this young man developed into something else, larger than him, which took over a sleepy town and made headline news all over the world.</p>
<p>In a powerful TIME essay, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has <a href="http://time.com/3132635/ferguson-coming-race-war-class-warfare/">argued</a> that the Ferguson protests are essentially about class. In an equally powerful reply in The Nation, Dave Zirin has <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/181310/my-major-problem-kareem-abdul-jabbars-powerful-essay-ferguson">said</a> that in this situation, racism trumps class.</p>
<p>Why does there need to be a hierarchy?</p>
<p>Michael Brown was so lightly killed because he was black. On US streets, that’s still a synonym for disposable, and it’s still perceived as being inferior.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, he was killed because he was poor. His belonging to a particular community and a particular social class marked him out just as powerfully as his skin colour.</p>
<p>The two, race and class, are not divisible categories here, to be analysed as separate phenomena. They are two sides of the same coin, a reflection of a pervasive social reality. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/aug/19/race-ferguson-inequality-opportunities-african-american-injustice">economics of poverty</a> have everything to do with race, especially in the US. Institutionalized racism leads to fewer social and economic opportunities for non-white Americans, which can spiral into a vicious circle of inequality, anger and injustice.</p>
<p>The ‘wealth gap’ the media talks about is not just between rich and poor; it has a <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/wealth-gap-grows-between-black-and-white-us">racial component</a> as well. Ignoring that means a dangerous slip down ‘American Dream’ territory. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/09/news/economy/america-economic-mobility/">American Dream</a> is just that: a dream.</p>
<p>The Ferguson protests are about more than Michael Brown’s death. They link in to a community’s desperation at seeing its members <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/181332/strange-fruit-ferguson">lynched</a> in broad daylight; to its inability to move out of poverty or to make itself heard, and to a complete disconnect from the people who police its streets and the leaders seen up-close only on TV.</p>
<p>In a sad twist of irony, the protests are taking place while the US has its first black president, serving his second term in the White House. If, at the beginning of his presidency in 2008, anyone expected Barack Obama to have a strong position on pervasive racism in the US, that hope has been extinguished by now. His <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/20/nothing-obama-and-holder-say-will-change-racial-debate/">political</a> ties to the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/barack-obama-ferguson-race-110165.html">conservative right</a> make it impossible for his stance to be anything but conciliatory and neutral, the equivalent of a <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/obama_men_of_color_are_seen_as_objects_of_fear/">weary</a> ‘Keep calm and carry on’.</p>
<p>Twelve days after Michael Brown’s death, the protests are still raging. They’ve been re-appropriated and re-drawn on racial and social lines, with violent youth admonished by the elderly, and everyone targeted by the police. There has been looting and teargas, riot gear and more than 60 arrests. A living hell, seen on live TV.</p>
<p>The question is, will it lead anywhere? Can a wider national movement bring much-needed change to a community brought to the brink, or will this stay a disparate protest of a few hundred people in a country of hundreds of millions?</p>

Too high for some students</h4></a><p><em>The government’s tough stance on immigration has lead to changes in its family settlement laws regarding non-EEA nationals and students are increasingly affected by these changes, finds <strong>Cristiana Moisescu</strong>.</em></p>
<p>As of July 2012, the new Family Immigration Law states that if a British citizen wants to bring a non-EEA relative into the country, he must earn £18,600 per annum and continue to do so after the settler’s application has been approved. This financial requirement rises to £22,400 if a child is involved, with another £2,400 for any additional child.</p>
<p>The new rule removes the right to third-party sponsorship and does not take into account the relative’s earnings (whether potential or guaranteed). As the law now stands, 47% of UK nationals would not be able to comply with it should they want to bring a non-EEA relative into the country (Migration Observatory, University of Oxford). Of these, the most affected groups are women (62%) and young people (58%) and while the rules affect any relatives abroad, the greatest impact is being felt by married couples, with families effectively forced to live apart.</p>
<p>On the 4th of March, the Royal Courts of Justice saw the beginning of an appeal trial regarding these laws, brought forward by three separate parties challenging the Home Office. The appeal comes as a response to a trial held in July 2013, where Mr. Justice Blake ruled that the current laws were “so onerous in effect as to be an unjustified and disproportionate interference with a genuine spousal relationship”. He also advised that the financial requirement be lowered to the minimum wage, a move that would be more inclusive. While the trial is ongoing, the government has put all applications on hold – that number currently stands at 3014.</p>
<p>The government estimates that 18,000 Britons are annually affected by these changes in immigration law, and among them are fellow students. Rachel Preston, 23, studying Arabic and Art History at SOAS, has been married for close to a year, to Ahmed, 28, who is a communications engineer, currently living in Cairo.</p>
<p>“I met my husband four years ago, before I came to SOAS, and the plan was always to get married during my year abroad. [...]So we got married last year on the 25th of March –it’s our one year anniversary soon. And since then we’ve just been going back and forth from Cairo on holidays and getting visit visas [...] which give you six months multiple entry.”</p>
<p>They see each other during holidays, but it feels less like married life and more like a long-distance relationship. “I’m married and I’m in a certain place in my life, but my life here without my husband doesn’t really reflect that. It doesn’t feel at all like a married life and it’s very frustrating having to go to Cairo and then leave each other again. And you just can’t plan anything – everyone has plans for after graduation, but my only goal is to try and earn £18,600.”</p>
<p>She isn’t alone in this situation. Jan Brulc, the communications manager for the Migrants’ Rights Network (MRN) says that “the income threshold affects a great number of students who are at the beginning of their career and although their earning potential is high, [they] can&#39;t provide that sort of income in the early years of their employment. We are in touch with a great deal of students and young people who wish to settle in the UK and start a family. This policy has had a devastating effect on them and many live in uncertainty about their future or have had to move abroad permanently and leave their life in the UK behind them.”</p>
<p>Although the implied message of the government seems to be that UK citizens who cannot comply with the regulations are expendable, Rachel doesn’t want to relocate.</p>
<p>“When people ask why don’t you just move to Cairo... I wouldn’t mind that, but I don’t want to be stuck in a position later down the line, when children are involved, where there might be a reason why I have to come back here and Ahmed still can’t. Also, I’m an only child and I really wouldn’t want to leave, it would be very upsetting for my family if. I also know it’s very stressful for them, because they’re constantly worried that I’ll just get fed up with it and say right, I’m going to Cairo.”</p>
<p>Steven Green, who leads Britcits, a campaign group for families divided by immigration laws, also sees students as a vulnerable group. “Young people are particularly affected - this is the age at which many people are likely to meet their partners, and also the age when people are embarking on a career and less likely to be earning huge salaries. Given that university students are likely to meet their partners while studying - and also that universities are international places - this is a huge issue for students.”</p>
<p>The court comments from last year have given hope to many that there might be an official ruling on the illegality of the laws, as the plaintiffs are arguing that the rules clash with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, the right to a private and family life. “Our position is that we campaign for the human right of families to be united. We see this as a human rights issue, not an economic issue. Families come in many shapes and sizes,” says Green.</p>
<p>Dr. Ala Sirriyeh, Lecturer in Sociology at Keele University, specializing in migration issues, agrees “that family life is a human right that needs to be protected. In a globalised world families are not always contained within a national border. Unfortunately, these new rules link rights to income levels, meaning some families are less valued.”</p>
<p>The new laws have not been created in a political vacuum, but as a continuation of the government’s tough stance on immigration, which has become the scapegoat for all of Britain’s financial problems. While immigration laws have toughened and anti-immigration narratives increased, it is the poor who are bearing the consequences.</p>
<p>According to the Home Office however, the laws have been put in place to safeguard the British taxpayer, by preventing unlawful immigrants from becoming a burden on the state and by ensuring that their integration is an easier process (the implication being that the less money you have, the less likely you are to integrate well). If you will, a sort of “for the people, against the people” move. What many are now decrying is the dependency link created between earning a certain income and the right to have a family, essentially, the monetization of love.</p>
<p>“We believe that being able to start a family in your own country should not be subject to the amount of money you make”, thinks Jan Brulc; nevertheless, “many genuine families have been kept apart, including children indefinitely separated from a parent with implications for their well-being and development.”</p>
<p>The case for children’s well-being was argued during the 2013 trial, and will likely be repeated at the appeal. In 2013, an all party parliamentary group (APPG) heard evidence from 175 people regarding the impact of the new family immigrations laws on their livelihood. That meeting produced a report which clearly states that while children’s livelihood should fall under the same article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), there is no sign that this was taken into account in any visa application in which children were involved.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect is the implication brought by the term ‘immigrant’ – it immediately evokes poor, ‘third world’ origins, low qualifications, and that is the way the term is used in the government’s rhetoric.</p>
<p>In practice, however, the laws affect everyone who is a non-EEA citizen, including members of the Commonwealth and US citizens, who are arguably affluent enough to not ‘be a burden on the state’.</p>
<p>Sirriyeh explains: “There has always been discrimination on the basis of financial status in migration policy. However, I think the new family migration rules heighten this even further. The hierarchical organisation of acceptable and less acceptable international relationships and family reflects class-based inequalities in the government&#39;s wider austerity policies. In contrast to transnational elites or &#39;expats&#39;, the new family migration rules imply that those on low incomes who are in international relationships and wish to be reunited with their family are somehow living beyond their means.”</p>
<p>The same APPG report mentioned above highlights some of the ludicrous consequences of the
new Family Immigration Law.</p>
<p>An Australian national who earns more than £250,000 is not eligible to settle in the UK because his wife, a UK national, has never worked (and does not intend to). Although this is an example of financial extremes, there are countless people who are affected under the same laws because the rules do not take into consideration the income of the non-EEA spouse.</p>
<p>While there is discrepancy in the rhetoric of the government (expat versus immigrant, businessman versus jobseeker), the law acts the same for all, giving way to ridiculous situations which better serve to highlight the absurdity of the rules.
Many of those the APPG heard also complained of the regional income discrepancy which the financial threshold set in the new rules completely ignores: “[I]f I was doing exactly the same job for the NHS in London I would meet the financial requirement and would be able to bring my wife here so I could carry on with my work and live a happy life.”(Individual submission, West Midlands – as quoted from the APPG Family Migration Inquiry Report June 2013)</p>
<p>Rachel, who is originally from Cornwall, agrees that regional discrimination makes a difference, as well-paying jobs are hard to find away from London. Should the financial threshold be lowered to the minimal wage, “it would put less pressure on me to find a well paying job, as a lot of graduates enter into graduate programmes or internships. It could mean that I could effectively just get a waiting job and work at it for six months, and then hopefully it would be fine.”</p>
<p>According to her, the government has “made these rules because they want to try and cut immigration in any way possible, because they’ve made immigration targets completely unrealistic. They can’t pick on the EU with regards to immigration so they’re going for any other route - non EU students and non-EEA spouses.”</p>
<p>Ironically enough, EU citizens, who fall under EU immigration laws rather than UK/home country law, can bring their non-EEA spouse into the UK. This is known as the Surinder Singh law and it is a route that many UK nationals have considered: move to another EU country for six months, then come back into the UK under EU citizen rights rather than UK ones and bring their spouse/relative with them. Rachel’s aware of this possibility, but thinks “it’s a waste of money” and does not want to uproot her life from the UK or Egypt in order to move to another EU country.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the new law is financially prohibitive – an application fee alone costs £1051 – and that it’s meant to be that way. The problem is that it’s also disrupting people’s lives, their future and their children’s future.</p>
<p>Rachel’s frustration with this situation only grows when she sees that “one of my friends is buying a flat with her boyfriend right now, another has just bought a house with her boyfriend, and just seeing their combined power, what they can do together... that makes me think [that] I want to be able to plan my future, whether it’s in England or in Cairo, I’d like to be able to have the choice.” Similarly, the new laws have taken away her choice regarding her immediate future: “I would love to do a master’s but can’t do one, [the law is] forcing me to choose between a master’s and my husband”.</p>
<p>The appeal currently being trialed has a lot of potential regarding the government’s response to the way this policy is affecting people, although in all likelihood the case will be taken forwards to the Supreme Court. A ruling is expected in five weeks’ time, although the 2013 trial took five months to offer a decision.</p>

<p>In an empty classroom, in the silence before the outpouring of her story, Amira (names have been changed to protect anonymity), 21, a SOAS final year student, chips at her purplish nail polish. Jet-black hair falls over hazel eyes and as she begins to talk rapidly, with no hint of hesitation, I see that she has a sweet voice, which matches her looks, still child-like. All this makes her story even more disturbing.</p>
<p>She recounts how, while in secondary school, she had her first boyfriend, who also happened to be white; in the eyes of her parents, that was a double wrong, so upon finding out, they took her out of school and prevented her from sitting her GCSEs. It was only through the help of a teacher who noticed her absence that she finally sat her exams, and then, once enrolled in an all-girls sixth form, she proceeded to take her A levels.</p>
<p>“They let me do my A levels, but I didn’t have a phone, I couldn’t go out, it was just go to school, come back home. So I worked super super hard so I could get into uni and get away from it all, but when the time came I was never allowed to go, even though I had offers at universities outside of London,” she says.</p>
<p>She took a gap year and reapplied to London universities, hoping that the proximity to home would make her father change her mind. When that didn’t work, “the only thing that he could think of was if I got married – that way my dad wouldn’t have to be worried that I would go off with other guys. At that time I was his responsibility and it would have affected his honour, [whereas] if I’m married, I’m affecting my husband‘s honour”.</p>
<p>An Islamic marriage, a niqah, was organized between her and a family friend who lived close by, and Amira was allowed to attend SOAS when term started. “I went on to lead a relatively normal life, but always knowing that [my husband] is there. When I was at university I would pretend that everything was fine and that I’m just like everyone else and enjoying my time, and when I went home, I would remember, ‘oh, I’m married, and I have to spend time with him and he’s a complete stranger [...] and there was this scary, emotional stress. The first year was really hard.”</p>
<p>Even though she was now married and going to university, Amira describes how her father would perform random checks in her bedroom, looking for clues as to her ‘bad’ behaviour, a practice that had started while she was still in secondary school, after he discovered that she had a boyfriend.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the discovery, Amira’s mother began sleeping on the floor of her daughter’s room, and if Amira then thought that it must be a form of spying on her, she has now come to understand that her mother had been frightened by the possibility of an honour killing, and so was trying to protect her.</p>
<p> At the same time, since her high-school romance was discovered, her father hadn’t spoken to her again, and still doesn’t. As a way to make herself understand her marriage and new life, she told her friends that she was engaged, “that it was my choice, that he was really nice and I really liked him, and that we got engaged because our families wanted us to, but we actually liked each other. [...] So I kind of spun it so that this was something that I wanted, I tried to make it something more acceptable to myself and to my friends.”</p>
<p>Towards the end of her three years of university and marriage, Amira found herself in an impossible position, in a marriage she had only accepted so that she could attend higher education, but a marriage that was nonetheless real, with all its long-term implications.</p>
<p>As the age gap between her and her husband began to show (she is 21, he is 27), they started fighting. These days, a divorce is an unpleasant, but feasible part of life; in Amira’s case, divorce would have meant the end of her university studies. The way she sees it, “it was quite a unique and crazy situation to be in, I didn’t want that marriage, but I was fighting for that marriage”.</p>
<p>Anicee van Engeland, Lecturer in Law at SOAS, says that forced marriage often occurs in conjunction with attending higher education: “Some girls go to university and then they get married after, but in some cases they get married and then they can go to university; but when you do that, you have to make sure that in the marriage contract it’s clearly written that they will let you go to university, because if it’s not written, the husband takes guardianship over you and then can prevent you from going.”</p>
<p>In the case of larger families, “once the first girl has negotiated access to university in exchange for marriage after, she has also negotiated for her sisters, so she cannot misbehave, because if she does, she closes the door for her sister, so it’s extremely stressful.”</p>
<p>Ayndrilla Singharay, Training and Development co-coordinator at ASHA, a South Asian organisation that works to end violence against women and girls, and which deals with a lot of cases of forced marriage, agrees with this. University is  seen “as an important time phase in a young woman’s life when it could happen; at the end of school and between university, that period is when a young woman is most at risk, because age is a factor. Often they’re pulled out of education before university, so they slip through the net.”</p>
<p>Being in a forced marriage has a lot of implications on different legal, social and psychological levels. Asking ‘why don’t they just leave?’ is not the right question, because a forced marriage weaves a web of complexities around it.</p>
<p>Singharay’s experience at ASHA gives her the insight to know that “it’s extremely hard to leave; we’re talking about very young girls here, 16, 17 year-olds, just leaving their whole families, their siblings, their school, their friends, and coming to a refuge. You don’t know what’s going to happen, you’re living on your own at that age, with no kind of support, and really, you miss your family, and regardless of what they’ve done to you or wanted you to do, you still love your parents.[...] And the community...it’s often very shameful if a girl leaves the family or if she gets other institutions involved, such as the police or social services, that would bring shame to the family as well, so they will be very isolated.”</p>
<p>From her discussions throughout the years with students who have admitted to being in a forced marriage, Van Engeland confirms this: “They were saying to me that they can’t live without their communities, that they don’t know how to live without one, that losing the respect of their family and their community – they wouldn’t be able to cope with it. So [leaving] would basically be a social death.”</p>
<p>Amira’s story follows this exact pattern, as she admits that “technically I could leave, I’m a lot older now, I could just leave, but it would mean I’d never see my mum again. And if I ran away, it would be worse for my dad’s honour, because up until now, [...] it was kept quiet. As soon as I ran away, questions would arise, why did she leave, and he could take it out on my mum or take it out on my sister and not let her go to university.”</p>
<p>Legally, forced marriage is not a criminal offence in England and Wales, but there is a major government push towards its criminalization. Since at present it is feared that only a handful of people report being in this situation, criminalizing the practice has the great potential of further driving it underground.</p>
<p>At present, the only legislation regarding forced marriage is the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007, which entitles victims to apply for a protection order against their families.</p>
<p>A few years ago, while teaching at the University of Bedfordshire, Anicee Van Engeland studied the act together with some of her students, who had contacted her because they were about to be forcibly married: “We looked at it together, but the problem with the act was that it said that they have to denounce their families, which could put them in a very dangerous position, it could end up with an honour killing; but at the same time, are you really going to denounce your parents to the police? Try to put yourself in their shoes, would you do it? It’s such a big step.” Singharay confirms that not one of the cases the organization has dealt with since the act has been passed has ever wanted to prosecute their parents.</p>
<p>Forced marriage can take on a number of different forms, and it can and does target boys as well as girls, although the numbers in the case of the former are even less reported. Another problem is that sometimes, the marriages aren’t contracted legally, in civil courts, so in case there’s a divorce, it becomes very hard to legislate it under UK laws.</p>
<p>It’s also quite often that a UK national will be taken out of the country to their parents’ country of origin, in order to be married there, for reasons which could range from keeping family and financial ties strong across the continents, to obtaining a citizenship for a foreign national once they’re married to a UK one.</p>
<p>Every year, the Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) brings out a report of the cases they deal with in that timeframe.</p>
<p>The 2012 report shows that 1485 cases of possible forced marriage have been investigated and also, just how uneven forced marriage statistics look like: age wise, the youngest case was 2 and the oldest 71. People aged 18-21 (30%) make up the majority of cases, with 82% female victims, and 18% male victims. Pakistan had the highest incidence of cases at 47.1%, but the list of countries includes Iran, Nigeria and the Ukraine. 22 cases involved victims who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) (FMU – Statistics January to December 2012).</p>
<p>So who is more susceptible to ending up in a forced marriage? There is a prevailing assumption that forced marriage only takes place in the Muslim communities, or that it is condoned by Islam; in fact, all major religions publicly condemn forced marriages, and forced marriages happen to people in all major religions, including Christianity and its different denominations.</p>
<p>Singharay says that “if you look at the media, you would think that South-Asian women are the typical case, because it’s usually a young South Asian woman from a very religious family, but that’s not always the case. We’ve had girls from families which aren’t religious at all, it’s nothing to do with religion; you might think that it’s only working class families, or that they’re not very well off, that’s also not the case, we’ve had very well off young women also having pressure put on them to get married. It’s a set of ideals which a family or community holds and it plays out in different ways, there is no default case.”</p>
<p>In the end, she says, it all boils down to a form of domestic abuse, even if there is no physical violence involved.</p>
<p>In the end, Amira was lucky. She was able to obtain an Islamic divorce, and she has not been pulled out of university yet, while her younger sister has just been accepted to university and their parents seem inclined to let her go. Amira would like to move away after her degree at SOAS ends, and take her PGCEs, start afresh, but the threat of a new marriage might already be hanging above.  “My biggest thing right now is to try and move out, get a job and live by myself for a bit. If that won’t be possible, I&#39;m scared of what will happen. This marriage has ended but what if they find someone else?”</p>

<p>One in four. That’s the UK statistic for people who will experience some kind of mental health issues during <em>any one year</em> (Office for National Statistics Psychiatric Morbidity report, 2001). One in four is also the statistic for women who are treated for depression, as opposed to one in ten for men (National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2003); according to the Mental Health Foundation, women are also twice more likely than men to experience anxiety. One fifth of students suffer from mental health problems, says a National Union of Students (NUS) report that came out in May this year.</p>
<p>The same report shows that 25% of students questioned experience suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. A 2012 report from the Office of National Statistics states that student suicide has increased by 36% for males and has doubled for females since 2007. A 2011 report from the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) stresses student vulnerability to a broad spectrum of mental health issues, from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (which people between 18 and 25 are particularly prone to developing). The reports are worrying, and they show a clear tendency of rising mental health distress in students.</p>
<p>In all these statistics and numbers however, you find people. Someone you know, a close friend, a member of your family perhaps, might easily be the one in four. At a university like SOAS, with a student body approaching 5000, the number of people experiencing mental health difficulties can only be equally high. So who are the people?</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s an early autumn’s day and I’m sitting on a bench next to Tom Mayer, in his back garden. A cat brushes past his hip as he speaks, hands in the air.</p>
<p>“There came a point when I realized what it was and what was happening to me,” he says. The sun’s shining on and he talks fast, enthusiastically, and this makes it difficult to imagine him ever being down, except that he’s talking about his experience with depression.</p>
<p>Tom, 26, is studying Arabic and Development Studies at SOAS. Now in his fourth year, he remembers how at the beginning of his second year things started going down: “I’d had a nice, very intense summer, working a lot, trying to earn money [...] it was very early in fresher’s week that I started to feel something was different. As the weeks and months went on, it just got into a downward spiral [...] and my mood became perpetually quite low.”</p>
<p>As it progressed, depression came to dominate his life, with “a lot of dwelling and repetitive thoughts, negativity and sadness.” The way he describes it, the main effects were psychological: when “a lot of things get blown out of proportion, your thinking becomes kind of skewed and you get paranoid and you cry a lot for what seems like no reason, but it’s just a very heavy sadness.”</p>
<p>During that time he also lost a lot of weight, started experiencing back pains due to hunching and his complexion became sallow as he stopped eating properly. Being enrolled full-time at university didn’t help. “You can’t think of anything else, you can’t read, so it’s very different in university, it’s very hard to focus on any of the texts, and certainly with Arabic it was a challenge, I couldn’t remember any of the vocabulary. I just had to survive in terms of my study.” Having to ‘survive’ university is not something that one necessarily thinks about when enrolling.</p>
<p>Chris Tomlins (names have been changed to protect anonymity), a SOAS student who graduated this year, also experienced anxiety attacks while in his second year at university. They were characterized by a “lack of sleep, stress, worrying about a particular issue, lots of negativity, lack of concentration, irrational focus.”</p>
<p>His attacks were mainly powered by anxiety over deadlines, and he recounts how he once had to hand in four different essays in the same day. Deadlines also compounded Tom’s stress feelings, to the point that “an essay would seem like a mountain, it was very difficult to rationalize... this intangible pressure, this stress coming from an idea, a deadline – it’s not a threat that you can see in front of you. [...] The pressure to do well, to succeed, all these things that are ripe in an university environment, they really had a strong effect on me, and there were points when I was considering deferring the year; when it came to exams I almost didn’t go.”</p>
<p>Academic-related stress appears in all the reports looking at the reasons why students experience mental health distress. Alison Barty, Head of Student Advice and Wellbeing and Senior Student Counsellor at SOAS, says that “every year, the most common [reasons relate to] academic concerns, procrastination, pressure about the course and then depression is always in the top two or three. Generally relationships, bereavement and loss are probably the most common causes.”</p>
<p>She says that at SOAS, “about one in ten students come to counselling services, and we’ve seen a proportion of students who identify disabled across a range of disabilities, with mental health concerns the second highest to date – but if you think that one in four people nationally are likely to experience mental health issues, there will be people who are not in the system.” Generally, female students access the counselling services more than male ones (about 65% female to 35% male) and the 2013 NUS report shows that of the students who’ve experienced mental health distress, 64% did not use any kind of formal services to address it, while 26% did not tell anyone about it.</p>
<p>“One of the things we’ve seen an increase in is students disclosing mental health,” she says, and a reason might be the Mentoring scheme in place for students with mental health issues.</p>
<p>If someone is a UK student with a recognized condition of long duration, with a diagnosis from a GP or a professional, they can qualify for a government-funded mentoring programme; if they’re international students, SOAS will provide the necessary funding. That doesn’t mean that it’s easy to draw people to counselling, as even in a progressive school like SOAS, the stigma surrounding mental health issues is there.</p>
<p>The idea, says Barty, is that “if you’re going to see a counsellor you’re mentally ill and that’s something that you don’t want people to know. [...] Some of the students who have actually made it here will talk about the stigma which they know from their own background.”</p>
<p>The concept that people sometimes respond better to anonymity is partly behind the creation of associations such as Nightline, which is run for students, by student volunteers. Jennifer Harper, an ex-Nightline volunteer, says that “there are lots of reasons why students might not publicly seek support for their emotional well-being: feeling as though their problems aren&#39;t big enough to bother anyone with; being embarrassed of what they have to say; fear of the stigma of mental health.”</p>
<p>“As Nightline is an anonymous service, callers don&#39;t have to give any details about themselves if they don&#39;t want to, which lets them be themselves in a way that they might not feel able to in other places. Everything that&#39;s said within Nightline is confidential, too, so students don&#39;t have to worry about their problems being made public.”</p>
<p>The lines are open from 6 PM until 8 AM the next morning, as it’s during the night that students are the most vulnerable to emotional distress, especially since most other mental health services are not usually available at that hour. Mags Godderidge, Nightline’s Charity Development Manager, says that “all Nightline volunteers undergo rigorous training locally to enable them to deal with calls competently and confidently”; the fact that the volunteers are also students and can empathize easier with other students’ calls is also very important.</p>
<p>In fact, peer support is something that’s increasingly recommended and pushed for within universities as well. At SOAS, the Student Union together with Student Advice and Wellbeing have “coordinated a Mental Health First Aid course prior to the start of term, for those interested in peer support. Sachiko [Kishi] has since held training days for the Buddy Scheme.</p>
<p>They have been well attended, however, limited resources means that they don&#39;t always fit in well with the student year,” says Co-President Welfare and Campaigns Leah Edwards.  In her opinion, “peer support can work, but it has to be designed around the wants/needs of those who use it. Peer support provides another layer of support, another opportunity for early intervention when problems arise, and can be incredibly empowering. But it has to be user-centred.” She hopes to develop another peer support scheme, the Tea and Empathy Group, so that it can have a regular presence in the JCR and encourage discussions around mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout their mental health difficulties, both Tom and Chris contacted the SOAS Student Advice and Wellbeing department (the former Student Services) and received counselling sessions that helped them regain their emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Chris calls it a success and feels that counselling gave him the confidence to get his work in on time, which in turn gave him the confidence to not be anxious over not being able to do something. Tom says the main tool he learned from counselling “was just to allow myself to be without putting too much pressure on myself [...] once I stopped punishing myself and feeling like I needed to do everything, that helped me a lot and counselling was a part of it.”</p>
<p>Neither one of them had reservations about approaching the counselling services, but Tom admits that he did use his discretion to a certain extent when talking about it, “although it was the only thing that I wanted to talk about, it dominated my world [...] I didn’t want to be seen as weak, and I thought that people would see me as weak in this position, by the way that I was behaving and seeming to be incapable to do certain things. But at the end of the day, people didn’t really care about that, it came more from me and my perspective on how people were viewing me.”</p>
<p>Whether it’s through peer support or more formal networks, whether it’s opening up to a friend or a member of your family, the most important part of recovering over mental health issues seems to be talking about it.</p>
<p>As Barty says, “we all have mental health, just like we have physical health.” It’s important to take care of both and to recognize that they represent equal parts of our well-being.</p>
