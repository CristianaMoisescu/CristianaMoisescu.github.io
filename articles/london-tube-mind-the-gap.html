<p>Phil Sayer, a voice-over artist who recorded warnings for several London Underground lines, as well as for adverts, died on Thursday according to statements on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sorry to announce that this service terminates here,&quot; his wife Elinor Hamilton said in the statement.</p>
<p>Hamilton described Sayer as a &quot;voice of reason, radio, and railways&quot; and &quot;a dearly loved husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend.&quot;</p>
<p>Sayer was a BBC regional TV and radio presenter in the 1980s, before setting up a voice-over business with his wife.</p>
<p>Phil Sayer provided the voiceover for the &quot;Mind the gap&quot; announcement on the Tube.</p>
<p>In 2014, he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, for which he underwent surgery and chemotherapy. A year later, the illness seemed to have abated.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is diagnosed too late, then surgery is no longer an option. Mine seems to have been caught just in time,&quot; Sayer told his local newspaper, the Bolton News, last year, while preparing to take part in the Great Manchester Run. &quot;It&#39;s great to be here a year down the line with every confidence I&#39;ve still got a future.&quot;</p>
<p>But in early April this year he retired, citing health concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to a sudden and unexpected decline in Phil&#39;s health, Sayer Hamilton Ltd is temporarily closing for business with immediate effect, and Phil will not be returning to work,&quot; read a statement on his company&#39;s website.</p><span class="cm-article--tags"><span class="label label-default card-link cm-article--tag">London</span></span><br><small>Originally published at  <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/15/travel/london-tube-announcer-death/">http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/15/travel/london-tube-announcer-death/</a></small><br><br><a href="javascript:window.history.back()" aria-label="Go Back" class="btn btn-primary">◄ Return to Articles</a></div></div></main></body></html>
