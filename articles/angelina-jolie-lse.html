<p>The Hollywood star will join the Centre for Women, Peace and Security as a contributor to its newly created MSc program in Women, Peace and Security.</p>
<p>Jolie&#39;s future colleagues, also announced on Monday, are Jane Connors, Director of International Advocacy at Amnesty International Geneva, William Hague, former UK Foreign Secretary and Madeleine Rees, Secretary General of the Women&#39;s International League for Peace and Freedom.</p>
<p>LSE is currently ranked at number 5 in the Times Higher Education UK University Rankings, reputed to be the definitive list of the world&#39;s best universities.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re thinking of applying for the course, enrolment starts in Autumn 2016, with classes beginning in Autumn 2017. These will include core modules such as &quot;Women, Peace and Security,&quot; &quot;Gender and Militarisation&quot; and &quot;Gender and Human Rights.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Women&#39;s rights</strong></p>
<p>But don&#39;t expect to bump into Angie down at the cafeteria every day.</p>
<p>According to the LSE, both Jolie and Hague &quot;will lecture or teach as often as their schedules will allow,&quot; and &quot;at least once a year, for each year of their fellowship.&quot;</p>
<p>Which makes it sound like the two will act more as guest lecturers, and means that no, they probably won&#39;t be sitting in on your tutorials.</p>
<p>In a statement released by the university, Jolie said she felt &quot;very encouraged by the creation of this master&#39;s program.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope other academic institutions will follow this example, as it is vital that we broaden the discussion on how to advance women&#39;s rights and end impunity for crimes that disproportionately affect women.&quot;</p>
<p>Hague and Jolie opened the university&#39;s Centre for Women, Peace and Security in February 2015, and are the co-founders of the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI).</p>
<p>Jolie is also a special envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p><span class="cm-article--tags"><span class="label label-default card-link cm-article--tag">News</span></span><br><small>Originally published at  <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/23/europe/angelina-jolie-lse/">http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/23/europe/angelina-jolie-lse/</a></small><br><br><a href="javascript:window.history.back()" aria-label="Go Back" class="btn btn-primary">◄ Return to Articles</a></div></div></main></body></html>
