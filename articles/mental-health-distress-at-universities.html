<p>One in four. That’s the UK statistic for people who will experience some kind of mental health issues during <em>any one year</em> (Office for National Statistics Psychiatric Morbidity report, 2001). One in four is also the statistic for women who are treated for depression, as opposed to one in ten for men (National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2003); according to the Mental Health Foundation, women are also twice more likely than men to experience anxiety. One fifth of students suffer from mental health problems, says a National Union of Students (NUS) report that came out in May this year.</p>
<p>The same report shows that 25% of students questioned experience suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. A 2012 report from the Office of National Statistics states that student suicide has increased by 36% for males and has doubled for females since 2007. A 2011 report from the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) stresses student vulnerability to a broad spectrum of mental health issues, from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (which people between 18 and 25 are particularly prone to developing). The reports are worrying, and they show a clear tendency of rising mental health distress in students.</p>
<p>In all these statistics and numbers however, you find people. Someone you know, a close friend, a member of your family perhaps, might easily be the one in four. At a university like SOAS, with a student body approaching 5000, the number of people experiencing mental health difficulties can only be equally high. So who are the people?
                                                                            *
It’s an early autumn’s day and I’m sitting on a bench next to Tom Mayer, in his back garden. A cat brushes past his hip as he speaks, hands in the air.</p>
<p>“There came a point when I realized what it was and what was happening to me,” he says. The sun’s shining on and he talks fast, enthusiastically, and this makes it difficult to imagine him ever being down, except that he’s talking about his experience with depression.</p>
<p>Tom, 26, is studying Arabic and Development Studies at SOAS. Now in his fourth year, he remembers how at the beginning of his second year things started going down: “I’d had a nice, very intense summer, working a lot, trying to earn money [...] it was very early in fresher’s week that I started to feel something was different. As the weeks and months went on, it just got into a downward spiral [...] and my mood became perpetually quite low.”</p>
<p>As it progressed, depression came to dominate his life, with “a lot of dwelling and repetitive thoughts, negativity and sadness.” The way he describes it, the main effects were psychological: when “a lot of things get blown out of proportion, your thinking becomes kind of skewed and you get paranoid and you cry a lot for what seems like no reason, but it’s just a very heavy sadness.”</p>
<p>During that time he also lost a lot of weight, started experiencing back pains due to hunching and his complexion became sallow as he stopped eating properly. Being enrolled full-time at university didn’t help. “You can’t think of anything else, you can’t read, so it’s very different in university, it’s very hard to focus on any of the texts, and certainly with Arabic it was a challenge, I couldn’t remember any of the vocabulary. I just had to survive in terms of my study.” Having to ‘survive’ university is not something that one necessarily thinks about when enrolling.</p>
<p>Chris Tomlins (names have been changed to protect anonymity), a SOAS student who graduated this year, also experienced anxiety attacks while in his second year at university. They were characterized by a “lack of sleep, stress, worrying about a particular issue, lots of negativity, lack of concentration, irrational focus.”</p>
<p>His attacks were mainly powered by anxiety over deadlines, and he recounts how he once had to hand in four different essays in the same day. Deadlines also compounded Tom’s stress feelings, to the point that “an essay would seem like a mountain, it was very difficult to rationalize... this intangible pressure, this stress coming from an idea, a deadline – it’s not a threat that you can see in front of you. [...] The pressure to do well, to succeed, all these things that are ripe in an university environment, they really had a strong effect on me, and there were points when I was considering deferring the year; when it came to exams I almost didn’t go.”</p>
<p>Academic-related stress appears in all the reports looking at the reasons why students experience mental health distress. Alison Barty, Head of Student Advice and Wellbeing and Senior Student Counsellor at SOAS, says that “every year, the most common [reasons relate to] academic concerns, procrastination, pressure about the course and then depression is always in the top two or three. Generally relationships, bereavement and loss are probably the most common causes.”</p>
<p>She says that at SOAS, “about one in ten students come to counselling services, and we’ve seen a proportion of students who identify disabled across a range of disabilities, with mental health concerns the second highest to date – but if you think that one in four people nationally are likely to experience mental health issues, there will be people who are not in the system.” Generally, female students access the counselling services more than male ones (about 65% female to 35% male) and the 2013 NUS report shows that of the students who’ve experienced mental health distress, 64% did not use any kind of formal services to address it, while 26% did not tell anyone about it.</p>
<p>“One of the things we’ve seen an increase in is students disclosing mental health,” she says, and a reason might be the Mentoring scheme in place for students with mental health issues.</p>
<p>If someone is a UK student with a recognized condition of long duration, with a diagnosis from a GP or a professional, they can qualify for a government-funded mentoring programme; if they’re international students, SOAS will provide the necessary funding. That doesn’t mean that it’s easy to draw people to counselling, as even in a progressive school like SOAS, the stigma surrounding mental health issues is there.</p>
<p>The idea, says Barty, is that “if you’re going to see a counsellor you’re mentally ill and that’s something that you don’t want people to know. [...] Some of the students who have actually made it here will talk about the stigma which they know from their own background.”</p>
<p>The concept that people sometimes respond better to anonymity is partly behind the creation of associations such as Nightline, which is run for students, by student volunteers. Jennifer Harper, an ex-Nightline volunteer, says that “there are lots of reasons why students might not publicly seek support for their emotional well-being: feeling as though their problems aren&#39;t big enough to bother anyone with; being embarrassed of what they have to say; fear of the stigma of mental health.”</p>
<p>“As Nightline is an anonymous service, callers don&#39;t have to give any details about themselves if they don&#39;t want to, which lets them be themselves in a way that they might not feel able to in other places. Everything that&#39;s said within Nightline is confidential, too, so students don&#39;t have to worry about their problems being made public.”</p>
<p>The lines are open from 6 PM until 8 AM the next morning, as it’s during the night that students are the most vulnerable to emotional distress, especially since most other mental health services are not usually available at that hour. Mags Godderidge, Nightline’s Charity Development Manager, says that “all Nightline volunteers undergo rigorous training locally to enable them to deal with calls competently and confidently”; the fact that the volunteers are also students and can empathize easier with other students’ calls is also very important.</p>
<p>In fact, peer support is something that’s increasingly recommended and pushed for within universities as well. At SOAS, the Student Union together with Student Advice and Wellbeing have “coordinated a Mental Health First Aid course prior to the start of term, for those interested in peer support. Sachiko [Kishi] has since held training days for the Buddy Scheme.</p>
<p>They have been well attended, however, limited resources means that they don&#39;t always fit in well with the student year,” says Co-President Welfare and Campaigns Leah Edwards.  In her opinion, “peer support can work, but it has to be designed around the wants/needs of those who use it. Peer support provides another layer of support, another opportunity for early intervention when problems arise, and can be incredibly empowering. But it has to be user-centred.” She hopes to develop another peer support scheme, the Tea and Empathy Group, so that it can have a regular presence in the JCR and encourage discussions around mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout their mental health difficulties, both Tom and Chris contacted the SOAS Student Advice and Wellbeing department (the former Student Services) and received counselling sessions that helped them regain their emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Chris calls it a success and feels that counselling gave him the confidence to get his work in on time, which in turn gave him the confidence to not be anxious over not being able to do something. Tom says the main tool he learned from counselling “was just to allow myself to be without putting too much pressure on myself [...] once I stopped punishing myself and feeling like I needed to do everything, that helped me a lot and counselling was a part of it.”</p>
<p>Neither one of them had reservations about approaching the counselling services, but Tom admits that he did use his discretion to a certain extent when talking about it, “although it was the only thing that I wanted to talk about, it dominated my world [...] I didn’t want to be seen as weak, and I thought that people would see me as weak in this position, by the way that I was behaving and seeming to be incapable to do certain things. But at the end of the day, people didn’t really care about that, it came more from me and my perspective on how people were viewing me.”</p>
<p>Whether it’s through peer support or more formal networks, whether it’s opening up to a friend or a member of your family, the most important part of recovering over mental health issues seems to be talking about it.</p>
<p>As Barty says, “we all have mental health, just like we have physical health.” It’s important to take care of both and to recognize that they represent equal parts of our well-being.</p>
