Seeing them immediately evokes the richness of her paintings, while poignantly offering an insight into her life. This is the effect of the Ishiuchi Miyako: Frida exhibition at Michael Hoppen Gallery, which collect’s Miyako photography of Kahlo’s wardrobe and belongings.</p>
<p>Until recently, most of these personal items were locked up in the dark, in a room in the ‘Casa Azul’, Frida’s house-turned-museum in Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. Her husband, painter Diego Rivera, had them stored there, to be presented to the public 15 years after his death. In fact, the room was only opened in 2004, uncovering aspects of Frida no album had catalogued so far (who knew she liked Revlon nail polish, in a deep, fiery pink, the name of which was ‘Orchid to you’?)</p>
<p>Japanese artist Ishiuchi Miyako was invited to photograph the items, which numbered over 300. Of these, only a handful are on display here, carefully arranged to paint the most subtle of portraits: there are hints at her illness, a testimony of her insatiable drive to create, her dark femininity.</p>
<p>The photos themselves seem to float in mid-air, echoing a dream-like Frida, who only exists in our imagination. What the real woman would have made of her personal memorabilia being showcased for everyone to see is hard to guess. These days, anything Frida elicits a strong response – her love letters to Spanish artist Jose Bartoli were auctioned off in April for $137,000 – and this glimpse into her private life is no exception.</p>
<p>Still, the viewer here is prevented from getting too close: the photographs are ethereal, hypnotic and the effect is hard to associate with the smells and texture of clothing. Reality is held at bay, with long, black gloves stretching out into the whiteness around, far from inviting. When would she have worn them? Does it really matter? A corset with skirt attached seems to be echoing a Soviet astronaut’s gear – only a closer look reveals her hand and drawings on the hard plaster.</p>
<p>There are also hints of glamorous Frida, with cat-like sunglasses and a turquoise bathing suit – is there a Hollywood star beneath the paint dirt? Then there is the artist at work – in this case, hand-stitching skirts, decorating a fake boot to make it hers, dispersing her creative energy into her clothes, which have become extensions of herself.</p>
<p>All in all, Miyako’s photographs encapsulate different versions of this mythical woman, while keeping the real one at bay, free from curious looks intruding. In a way, it’s as if that locked room was never opened.</p>
<p>Ishiuchi Miyako: Frida runs at the Michael Hoppen gallery until 12 July 2015.</p><span class="cm-article--tags"><span class="label label-default card-link cm-article--tag">Frida Kahlo</span></span><br><small>Originally published at  <a href="http://www.theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/frida-kahlo-s-things-photographing-the-possessions-of-an-icon-/">http://www.theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/frida-kahlo-s-things-photographing-the-possessions-of-an-icon-/</a></small><br><br><a href="javascript:window.history.back()" aria-label="Go Back" class="btn btn-primary">◄ Return to Articles</a></div></div></main></body></html>
