<p>Ted Cruz beat all expectations (and Donald Trump), winning 27.6 of the vote at the Iowa Caucus yesterday, with Trump coming in a close second, at 24.3. The New Hampshire primary is next, where Trump is strongly in the lead with 33.7 per cent to Cruz&#39;s 11.5 per cent. </p>
<p>If Cruz manages to beat Trump there, he stands a good chance of gaining enough momentum to become the official Republican nominee for the US presidential elections. But just who is he?</p>
<p><strong>Who is Ted Cruz?</strong></p>
<p>A Princeton and Harvard graduate, the Republican US Senator for Texas is of Cuban descent, Canada-born and Texas-bred. Once called &quot;the distinguished wacko bird from Texas&quot; by <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/ted-cruz-republican-senator-october-2013">GQ</a> magazine, Cruz started out as one of George W Bush&#39;s 1999 campaign advisors. He is also the former Solicitor General of Texas, as well as lawyer to big business names such as Pfizer and Toyota. In 2012 he moved on to national politics, becoming the Republican senator for Texas, and receiving a public endorsement from the likes of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. </p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s he done so far?</strong></p>
<p>As Texas Senator, he has backed more than 50 bills, some more controversial than others. Among these are an Obamacare repeal, a bill to prohibit the use of drones to kill United States citizens while on US soil, a move to make it harder for criminals to obtain firearms and a bill backing off-shore oil drilling and fracking. </p>
<p>On the Hill, Cruz enraged former Speaker of the House John Boehner when he tried to shut down the government over the Obamacare negotiations and has criticized colleagues publicly, thus alienating most of the GOP leadership. </p>
<p><strong>What does he stand for?</strong></p>
<p>Son of a Christian pastor, Cruz is a staunch Christian, deriving a lot of his power base from the Evangelical community. </p>
<p>To his voters, Cruz is also the anti-establishment, all-too-conservative, grass-roots Republican who wants to do away with corruption in the GOP. Cruz made this clear when he told the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2014: &quot;How do we win elections? In the contrast between corrupt Washington and the American people.&quot; To that effect, he&#39;s dubbed his campaign the &quot;Movement for Courageous Conservatives&quot;, and based on his Iowa win, it seems to be working. </p>
<p>On major issues, his stance is extremely conservative: he is decidedly against President Obama and Obamacare, as well as against the DREAM act and any move which would allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the US. He also strongly supports the Second Amendment and the death penalty, as well as being pro-life and against same-sex marriages or civil partnerships. Oh, and he&#39;s a climate-change denier too.</p>
<p>On foreign affairs, he has declared in the past that &quot;carpet-bombing&quot; Syria &quot;until the sand glowed&quot; would be a good idea to deal with IS. He&#39;s also all for putting a halt to the Iran negotiations, bringing back tougher sanctions and tightening the US-Israeli relationship, which is a &quot;strategic bedrock&quot; for defence. </p>
<p><strong>Can he win the nomination?</strong></p>
<p>His strained relationship with the GOP leadership would make that difficult, but his Tea Party credentials and Evangelical community power-base can provide him with enough votes for momentum, points out <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/ted-cruz-wins-iowa-caucus-donald-trump-marco-rubio-2016-election">The Guardian</a>.  On the other hand, him and Donald Trump are fighting for the anti-establishment position, splitting the vote, shows <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/28/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-anti-establishment/">CNN</a>. In that case, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, already a surprise third place win in Iowa, might step in and pick up the undecided. </p><span class="cm-article--tags"><span class="label label-default card-link cm-article--tag">US Elections 2016</span></span><br><small>Originally published at  <a href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/us-election-2016/69230/ted-cruz-the-man-who-beat-donald-trump-in-iowa">http://www.theweek.co.uk/us-election-2016/69230/ted-cruz-the-man-who-beat-donald-trump-in-iowa</a></small><br><br><a href="javascript:window.history.back()" aria-label="Go Back" class="btn btn-primary">◄ Return to Articles</a></div></div></main></body></html>
