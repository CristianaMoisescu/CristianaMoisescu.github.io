<p><strong>The Noise of Time by Julian Barnes</strong></p>
<p>In his first novel after &#39;The Sense of An Ending&#39;, which won the Man Booker Prize in 2011, Barnes recounts the life of Dmitri Shostakovich, the famed Soviet composer whose music and personal fortune were intricately linked to that of his country: in the span of a decade, he went from celebrated cultural landmark, to officially denounced for being too &#39;Western&#39;, and struggled all his life with the Communist Party&#39;s absolute rule over his music. </p>
<p>Barnes has written an ambitious book, says <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-noise-of-time-by-julian-barnes-book-review-author-misses-a-beat-a6801251.html">The Independent</a>, with a great historical approach, but &#39;we read him for an arresting story, and this is, sadly, not what we get&#39;.</p>
<p>On the contrary, this is &quot;a complex meditation on the power, limitations and likely endurance of art&quot;, says Alex Clark at the Guardian, who extolls Barnes for being &quot;neither afraid of extremely high-class erudition nor of writing about sausages. It is a useful skill to have if you want to keep your readers on their toes.&quot;</p>
<p>While you wait: Dreams of My Russian Summers, by Andrei Makine</p>
<p><em>Out on 28 January 2016</em></p>

<p><strong>The High Mountains of Portugal by Yann Martel</strong></p>
<p>This is &#39;Life of Pi&#39; author Yann Martel&#39;s fourth novel, and everyone&#39;s buzzing about it. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not hard to understand why, as Martel is the winner of the 2002 Man Booker Prize for &#39;Life of Pi&#39;, the breakthrough book-turned-blockbuster movie. </p>
<p>Starting in Lisbon, 1904, where Tomas finds an old journal hinting at a deep secret, the book weaves three different stories in a road-trip across four centuries and two continents, exploring themes of love, loss and heartbreak. </p>
<p>It might even turn out to be a serious award contender, and even those who weren&#39;t pleased with Martel&#39;s latest book, &#39;Beatrice and Virgil&#39;, are putting this on their &#39;must-read&#39; lists for 2016.</p>
<p>While you wait: How to be both, by Ali Smith</p>
<p><em>Out on 02 February, 2016</em></p>

<p><strong>Thus Bad Begins by Javier Marías</strong></p>
<p>In 1980&#39;s Spain, a young man, Juan de Vere, finds himself trapped in an unsettling love triangle, as the assistant to a famous filmmaker, Eduardo Muriel. </p>
<p>As Muriel&#39;s wife flits in and out of the book and into other people&#39;s beds, Juan is tasked by the jealous husband to find out all he can about one of her mysterious old friends, who seems to be inexplicably linked to the Franco regime. </p>
<p>Javier Marías has a knack for exploring disquieting relationships (and pair them with Shakespeare themes, such as this Hamlet-inspired one), and this looks to be a similar affair.</p>
<p>While you wait: Rhapsody: A Dream Novel, by Arthur Schnitzler</p>
<p><em>Out on 25 February, 2016</em></p>
<p><strong>What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours by Helen Oyeyemi</strong></p>
<p>With five novels under her belt and a subsequent Granta nomination for Best Young British Novelists of 2013, Oyeyemi is one of Britain&#39;s new powerful voices. </p>
<p>&#39;What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours&#39; is her first short story collection, inspired by fairy tales and dark secrets, magically reworked throughout the book. Short stories have sometimes been unfairly given a wide berth by readers, so Oyeyemi&#39;s book couldn&#39;t come at a better time. </p>
<p>While you wait: Dear Life, by Alice Munro</p>
<p><em>Out on 08 March 2016</em></p>

<p><strong>The Pier Falls by Mark Haddon</strong></p>
<p>He of &#39;The Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night-time&#39; fame will have his first collected short stories published this May. The stories touch upon dark themes such as war, abandonment and natural disasters, all leading to a death of sorts - his wife apparently asked him to write at least one where no one dies - but <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/fiction-this-week-mark-haddon-2015-11-16">Haddon</a> says they &quot;are bound together by an empathy for sometimes unlovable people in difficult situations&quot;. If your interest is piqued, you can read the first of these, &#39;The Pier Falls&#39;, <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/04/pier-falls-new-short-story-mark-haddon">here</a>.</p>
<p>While you wait:  The Bazaar of Bad Dreams, by Stephen King</p>
<p><em>Out on 10 May, 2016</em></p>

<p><strong>Barkskins by Annie Proulx</strong></p>
<p>Annie Proulx has spent ten years working on her latest novel, &#39;Barkskins&#39;, and it looks set to become a bestseller even before its publication. Set in 17th century New France, the book spans across generations to tell the story of two French settlers and their trials and sorrows, reaching all the way to China and New Zealand. The book has already been picked up by Scott Rudin Productions, which will turn it into a miniseries, set to premiere globally in 171 countries and 45 languages. Can this be the new Brokeback Mountain?</p>
<p>While you wait: Lila, by Marilynne Robinson</p>

<p><strong>Here I Am by Jonathan Safran Foer</strong></p>
<p>Yet another highly anticipated book, &#39;Here I Am&#39; is Jonathan Safran Foer&#39;s first novel since 2005, and there&#39;s already much hype around it. Set in today&#39;s Washington, DC, it follows the implosion of an American-Jewish family over the course of a month, as divorce and tragedy take hold of their lives, while overseas, a massive earthquake rocks the Middle East and Israel&#39;s political foundations. &quot;It’s got this high-wire inventiveness and intensity of imagination in it,&quot; says Foer&#39;s editor Eric Chinski, while the <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/new-novel-from-jonathan-safran-foer-coming-in-september/?_r=0">New York Times</a> is quick to point out some interesting autobiographical similarities. </p>
<p>While you wait: Portnoy&#39;s Complaint, by Phillip Roth</p>
