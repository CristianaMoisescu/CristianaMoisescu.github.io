He has surpassed expectations so far, but can he secure the Democratic Nomination?</em></p>
<p>Seven months ago, nobody thought a self-professed social-democrat would get this far in the US presidential elections, but Bernie Sanders has managed to give Hillary Clinton a run for her money. </p>
<p>The two came out of last week&#39;s Iowa caucuses in a virtual tie, with Clinton slightly leading at 49.8 per cent, to Sanders&#39; 49.6. It&#39;s even been <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10893418/iowa-caucus-2016-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton">reported</a> that at least four different Democratic caucuses were decided by a coin toss between the two of them. </p>
<p><strong>Where did he come from?</strong></p>
<p>He&#39;s been called the Socialist Senator, the insurgent candidate, the populist prophet, but the 74-year-old US Vermont Senator is nothing short of a miracle. Of Jewish origin, Sanders started off as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1981, and became a Vermont Senator in 2007. He became a Democrat in 2015, having been the longest-serving independent in US congressional history until then. He runs on a socialist policy platform, similar to Scandinavian socialist policies, and he has put inequality issues at the heart of his campaign. </p>
<p>He is an ultra-liberal and anti-establishment (&quot;it is just too late for establishment politics,&quot; he told the people of Iowa after the caucus results came in), and has a track record for being outspoken against the donor industry surrounding politicians&#39; campaigns. He was also one of the few vocal opponents of the Iraq war. </p>
<p><strong>How far can Bernie go?</strong></p>
<p>Preliminary polls show him comfortably in the lead for the New Hampshire primary which will take place on 9 February, with 55.5 points to Clinton&#39;s 38. This isn&#39;t a surprise, says <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10892152/iowa-caucus-result-clinton-wins">Vox</a>, thanks to the state&#39;s proximity to Vermont, Sanders&#39; home state. The fact that Iowa has given him a big momentum can&#39;t hurt either. 
If he wins New Hampshire, that &quot;could create a real opening for Sanders, attracting donors and volunteers to help him compete in later races.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Would that guarantee success?</strong></p>
<p>Far from it. The primary states are all heavily white and heavily liberal, a demographic which Sanders appeals to, so his high polling figures here are to be expected. Once the election opens up to other states, with less uniform demographics, things will change. </p>
<p>Clinton&#39;s relationship with black voters is the &quot;firewall for Clinton’s candidacy and the Democratic establishment writ large&quot;, says <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/hillary_clinton_s_ties_to_black_democrats_will_save_her_campaign_from_bernie.html">Slate</a>, and as long as that status quo is maintained, she will be tough to beat. &quot;If [Sanders] can break or subvert Clinton’s relationship with black Democrats, he can win. If he can’t, he won’t.&quot; </p>
<p>So far, polls are sceptical. According to <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10892152/iowa-caucus-result-clinton-wins">NBC News figures</a>, white supporters divide almost equally between Sanders and Clinton (46 per cent to 44 per cent). Black and Hispanic voters, however, flock to Clinton, with only 20 per cent of blacks supporting Sanders, and 27 per cent of Hispanics. He needs to do better.</p>
<p><strong>Any good news?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Iowa. </p>
<p>Results show that Sanders is changing the game in the below 30 demographic, with a staggering difference between him and Clinton when it comes to voters between the ages of 17 and 29, where he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/02/bernie-sanders-crushed-hillary-clinton-by-70-points-among-young-people-in-iowa-but/">won</a> 84 per cent of the votes.  Owen Jones in the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/02/bernie-sanders-requests-vote-count-tight-finish-iowa-caucus-clinton">Guardian</a> points out that ignoring these figures – or indeed, that demographic – is dangerous for any political elite, Clinton included.  If Sanders manages to widen the overall gap there between him and Clinton, he will stand a better chance. </p>
<p>On the other hand, seven out of ten voters over 65 went to Clinton, and that&#39;s another target Sanders needs to win over. 
Iowa also showed that Clinton needs a better campaign if she wants a more straightforward win, and Sanders can capitalize on that. &quot;She is leaving Iowa tied with Sanders, dogged by her emails [scandal], and struggling to excite Democrats about her candidacy,&quot; says Ezra Klein at <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10892802/iowa-caucus-bernie-sanders-tie">Vox</a>. On top of that, she&#39;s also tied herself into a knot with the Democratic elite, who have banked on her for a strong win, which she doesn&#39;t seem to be delivering right now.  </p>
<p><strong>What can Sanders do?</strong></p>
<p>Work better at improving his overall numbers with more diverse demographics. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even if that happens, he will face a problem with the democratic elite who is backing Clinton in their majority and who are facing disaster if she doesn’t win:  they&#39;ve &quot;put themselves in a position where Sanders is their only viable alternative to Clinton — and they don&#39;t see him as all that viable.&quot; </p><span class="cm-article--tags"><span class="label label-default card-link cm-article--tag">US Elections 2016</span></span><br><small>Originally published at  <a href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/us-election-2016/69301/who-is-bernie-sanders-and-can-he-go-all-the-way">http://www.theweek.co.uk/us-election-2016/69301/who-is-bernie-sanders-and-can-he-go-all-the-way</a></small><br><br><a href="javascript:window.history.back()" aria-label="Go Back" class="btn btn-primary">◄ Return to Articles</a></div></div></main></body></html>
