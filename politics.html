<p>Ted Cruz beat all expectations (and Donald Trump), winning 27.6 of the vote at the Iowa Caucus yesterday, with Trump coming in a close second, at 24.3. The New Hampshire primary is next, where Trump is strongly in the lead with 33.7 per cent to Cruz&#39;s 11.5 per cent. </p>
<p>If Cruz manages to beat Trump there, he stands a good chance of gaining enough momentum to become the official Republican nominee for the US presidential elections. But just who is he?</p>
<p><strong>Who is Ted Cruz?</strong></p>
<p>A Princeton and Harvard graduate, the Republican US Senator for Texas is of Cuban descent, Canada-born and Texas-bred. Once called &quot;the distinguished wacko bird from Texas&quot; by <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/ted-cruz-republican-senator-october-2013">GQ</a> magazine, Cruz started out as one of George W Bush&#39;s 1999 campaign advisors. He is also the former Solicitor General of Texas, as well as lawyer to big business names such as Pfizer and Toyota. In 2012 he moved on to national politics, becoming the Republican senator for Texas, and receiving a public endorsement from the likes of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. </p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s he done so far?</strong></p>
<p>As Texas Senator, he has backed more than 50 bills, some more controversial than others. Among these are an Obamacare repeal, a bill to prohibit the use of drones to kill United States citizens while on US soil, a move to make it harder for criminals to obtain firearms and a bill backing off-shore oil drilling and fracking. </p>
<p>On the Hill, Cruz enraged former Speaker of the House John Boehner when he tried to shut down the government over the Obamacare negotiations and has criticized colleagues publicly, thus alienating most of the GOP leadership. </p>
<p><strong>What does he stand for?</strong></p>
<p>Son of a Christian pastor, Cruz is a staunch Christian, deriving a lot of his power base from the Evangelical community. </p>
<p>To his voters, Cruz is also the anti-establishment, all-too-conservative, grass-roots Republican who wants to do away with corruption in the GOP. Cruz made this clear when he told the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2014: &quot;How do we win elections? In the contrast between corrupt Washington and the American people.&quot; To that effect, he&#39;s dubbed his campaign the &quot;Movement for Courageous Conservatives&quot;, and based on his Iowa win, it seems to be working. </p>
<p>On major issues, his stance is extremely conservative: he is decidedly against President Obama and Obamacare, as well as against the DREAM act and any move which would allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the US. He also strongly supports the Second Amendment and the death penalty, as well as being pro-life and against same-sex marriages or civil partnerships. Oh, and he&#39;s a climate-change denier too.</p>
<p>On foreign affairs, he has declared in the past that &quot;carpet-bombing&quot; Syria &quot;until the sand glowed&quot; would be a good idea to deal with IS. He&#39;s also all for putting a halt to the Iran negotiations, bringing back tougher sanctions and tightening the US-Israeli relationship, which is a &quot;strategic bedrock&quot; for defence. </p>
<p><strong>Can he win the nomination?</strong></p>
<p>His strained relationship with the GOP leadership would make that difficult, but his Tea Party credentials and Evangelical community power-base can provide him with enough votes for momentum, points out <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/ted-cruz-wins-iowa-caucus-donald-trump-marco-rubio-2016-election">The Guardian</a>.  On the other hand, him and Donald Trump are fighting for the anti-establishment position, splitting the vote, shows <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/28/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-anti-establishment/">CNN</a>. In that case, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, already a surprise third place win in Iowa, might step in and pick up the undecided. </p>

He has surpassed expectations so far, but can he secure the Democratic Nomination?</em></p>
<p>Seven months ago, nobody thought a self-professed social-democrat would get this far in the US presidential elections, but Bernie Sanders has managed to give Hillary Clinton a run for her money. </p>
<p>The two came out of last week&#39;s Iowa caucuses in a virtual tie, with Clinton slightly leading at 49.8 per cent, to Sanders&#39; 49.6. It&#39;s even been <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10893418/iowa-caucus-2016-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton">reported</a> that at least four different Democratic caucuses were decided by a coin toss between the two of them. </p>
<p><strong>Where did he come from?</strong></p>
<p>He&#39;s been called the Socialist Senator, the insurgent candidate, the populist prophet, but the 74-year-old US Vermont Senator is nothing short of a miracle. Of Jewish origin, Sanders started off as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1981, and became a Vermont Senator in 2007. He became a Democrat in 2015, having been the longest-serving independent in US congressional history until then. He runs on a socialist policy platform, similar to Scandinavian socialist policies, and he has put inequality issues at the heart of his campaign. </p>
<p>He is an ultra-liberal and anti-establishment (&quot;it is just too late for establishment politics,&quot; he told the people of Iowa after the caucus results came in), and has a track record for being outspoken against the donor industry surrounding politicians&#39; campaigns. He was also one of the few vocal opponents of the Iraq war. </p>
<p><strong>How far can Bernie go?</strong></p>
<p>Preliminary polls show him comfortably in the lead for the New Hampshire primary which will take place on 9 February, with 55.5 points to Clinton&#39;s 38. This isn&#39;t a surprise, says <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10892152/iowa-caucus-result-clinton-wins">Vox</a>, thanks to the state&#39;s proximity to Vermont, Sanders&#39; home state. The fact that Iowa has given him a big momentum can&#39;t hurt either. 
If he wins New Hampshire, that &quot;could create a real opening for Sanders, attracting donors and volunteers to help him compete in later races.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Would that guarantee success?</strong></p>
<p>Far from it. The primary states are all heavily white and heavily liberal, a demographic which Sanders appeals to, so his high polling figures here are to be expected. Once the election opens up to other states, with less uniform demographics, things will change. </p>
<p>Clinton&#39;s relationship with black voters is the &quot;firewall for Clinton’s candidacy and the Democratic establishment writ large&quot;, says <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/hillary_clinton_s_ties_to_black_democrats_will_save_her_campaign_from_bernie.html">Slate</a>, and as long as that status quo is maintained, she will be tough to beat. &quot;If [Sanders] can break or subvert Clinton’s relationship with black Democrats, he can win. If he can’t, he won’t.&quot; </p>
<p>So far, polls are sceptical. According to <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10892152/iowa-caucus-result-clinton-wins">NBC News figures</a>, white supporters divide almost equally between Sanders and Clinton (46 per cent to 44 per cent). Black and Hispanic voters, however, flock to Clinton, with only 20 per cent of blacks supporting Sanders, and 27 per cent of Hispanics. He needs to do better.</p>
<p><strong>Any good news?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Iowa. </p>
<p>Results show that Sanders is changing the game in the below 30 demographic, with a staggering difference between him and Clinton when it comes to voters between the ages of 17 and 29, where he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/02/bernie-sanders-crushed-hillary-clinton-by-70-points-among-young-people-in-iowa-but/">won</a> 84 per cent of the votes.  Owen Jones in the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/02/bernie-sanders-requests-vote-count-tight-finish-iowa-caucus-clinton">Guardian</a> points out that ignoring these figures – or indeed, that demographic – is dangerous for any political elite, Clinton included.  If Sanders manages to widen the overall gap there between him and Clinton, he will stand a better chance. </p>
<p>On the other hand, seven out of ten voters over 65 went to Clinton, and that&#39;s another target Sanders needs to win over. 
Iowa also showed that Clinton needs a better campaign if she wants a more straightforward win, and Sanders can capitalize on that. &quot;She is leaving Iowa tied with Sanders, dogged by her emails [scandal], and struggling to excite Democrats about her candidacy,&quot; says Ezra Klein at <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10892802/iowa-caucus-bernie-sanders-tie">Vox</a>. On top of that, she&#39;s also tied herself into a knot with the Democratic elite, who have banked on her for a strong win, which she doesn&#39;t seem to be delivering right now.  </p>
<p><strong>What can Sanders do?</strong></p>
<p>Work better at improving his overall numbers with more diverse demographics. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even if that happens, he will face a problem with the democratic elite who is backing Clinton in their majority and who are facing disaster if she doesn’t win:  they&#39;ve &quot;put themselves in a position where Sanders is their only viable alternative to Clinton — and they don&#39;t see him as all that viable.&quot; </p>

<p>Thus ran the lyrics from Goodbye to Gravity’s song ‘The day we die’, as they played in the Colectiv nightclub on 30 October at the launch of their new album, <em>Mantras of War</em>.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, a fire broke out near the stage, set off by celebratory fireworks. In less than 15 minutes, it had swept through the club, killing 25 people and gravely injuring another 185. Among the dead, two of the band’s members, Mihai Alexandru and Vlad Telea.</p>
<p>A week later, on 3 November, the same lyrics appeared on protest signs, and were sung and shouted by throngs of people moving towards Bucharest’s Victoriei Square, to call out the government on its shameless lack of accountability. In total, more than 25,000 took part in the night’s protest.</p>
<p>On 4 November, an estimated 70,000 marched through the streets of Romania, filling their local squares, shouting down the country’s politics.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Victor Ponta had resigned earlier that day, taking down a much-maligned government with him. His resignation was quickly followed by that of Cristian Piedone Popescu, one of Bucharest’s district mayors, in whose jurisdiction the club was located.</p>
<p>There’s a sequence of events there which might not be immediately visible to the untrained eye, but to Romanians they are all too painfully connected.</p>
<p>Corruption links both the fire and the government: endemic, parasitic corruption. The club where the fire took place was operating without proper health and safety authorizations, with local authorities quietly ignoring the situation. There are hundreds of clubs like that all over the country, all with similar hazardous conditions.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written about the country’s corruption scandals <a href="http://newint.org/blog/2014/08/12/romanian-politician-convicted/">before</a>, but none have had quite the same emotional impact as this one. High-level corruption, involving exorbitant sums of money, rarely breaks into the daily worries of ordinary citizens, but petty corruption, bribes, shortcuts and back-alleying are part of a system known to all. Until now, however, the price had never been so high.</p>
<p>The Colectiv fire was merely a last, tragic drop in a sea of scandals, all involving cronyism and powerful politicians.</p>
<p>There’s the former vice-president, Gabriel Oprea, who, just two weeks ago, was up to his neck in a scandal involving the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/10/27/world/europe/ap-eu-romania-police-officer.html">death</a> of one of his police officers, who died in a motorcycle accident as he was speeding at 240 kilometres per hour as part of Oprea’s official motorcade; there’s the Social Democrat party leader, Liviu Dragnea, who recently <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/10/12/uk-romania-leftists-idUKKCN0S61AF20151012">ran</a> for that leadership position against himself and won it with a resounding 97%; and finally, Ponta himself, whose latest exploits include an <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/romanian-prime-minister-victor-ponta-indicted-on-corruption-charges-1442507635">indictment</a> for money-laundering, forgery and tax evasion.</p>
<p>These politicians are just some of Romania’s version of ‘Goodfellas’, apparatchiks too accustomed to play dirty to worry about individual consequences; until recently, they were also accustomed to winning.</p>
<p>The real shakedown started a year ago, when Ponta’s Social Democrat party – a reworking of the old Communist Party – failed to secure a sure-win presidential election, following a <a href="http://newint.org/blog/2014/11/19/romanian-elections/">diaspora voting scandal</a>which brought people to the streets in their thousands, abroad as well as at home.</p>
<p>The votes went instead to current Liberal president Klaus Iohannis, but they were empty votes, sealed in desperation by a people tired of letting ‘them’ have their way.</p>
<p>Now the president is no better than a mannequin, only able to communicate through his Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/klausiohannis/?fref=ts">page</a>: ‘I understand what is being asked and what is expected, and they are right, someone has to take political responsibility. The next step is for politicians, who cannot ignore this sentiment of revolt,’ he says.</p>
<p>On 5 November, he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/world/europe/sorin-cimpeanu-interim-prime-minister-romania.html?smid=fb-share">appointed</a> an interim prime minister, Sorin Campeanu, former Minister for Education, who is another member of the Old Guard. In a statement, Iohannis acknowledged the ongoing protests, saying that he has decided ‘to consult for the first time a new actor: the civil society’ and that he will meet up with ‘a group representing both the civil society and what we call “the street”.’</p>
<p>Ponta, meanwhile, will slink back to the shadows for the time being. There’s a formidably nice prosecutor <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/woman-leading-war-on-corruption-romania">waiting</a> to talk to him about those money-laundering charges, and there’s no better time to do it than now, when he is stripped of immunity and unencumbered by his well-meaning cronies.</p>
<p>There has been great deal of talk about the ‘social media’ revolutions – the Arab Spring sparked the concept, and now social media is organically propelling similar movements in Europe. There’s also a great deal of hope surrounding this – the Facebook generation, they’re calling us.</p>
<p>With the protest on 4 November, Romanians proved that they can rally around a common cause and be moved enough to take to the streets, in numbers higher than had been seen since the revolution which toppled communism 25 years ago. They proved that they can’t be bought off with mere resignations, that the cancer grows deeper.</p>
<p>Even so, all is not well. <a href="http://horiaghibutiu.ro/de-ce-nu-mai-ies-in-piata-universitatii/">Reports</a>  have come from protesters out on the streets talking of suspicious groups overriding the movement, being violent, manoeuvring the situation. A closer look shows them to be party affiliates, local thugs and paid bullhorns.</p>
<p>Now that the prime minister and his government have toppled, it’s easier than ever to get side-tracked, to forget to keep demanding real change, not just a nominal one. There are questions to be answered now: what kind of political system do we want? What kind of country do we want to grow up in, grow old in?</p>
<p>Still, even with the 60,000 out in the streets, and with another protest scheduled for this week, one can’t help but wonder: why did we let it go so far? And since we have, aren’t we part of the system too?</p>
<p>‘Corruption kills’, said many of the protesters’ signs. So far, the death toll has reached 33, and counting.</p>

<p>Two frogs fall into a bucket of milk and can’t jump out again; one gives up paddling and drowns; the second one refuses to do so and keeps paddling until the milk turns into cream and it is able to get out.</p>
<p>This is a story Bahraini activist Maryam Abdulhadi al-Khawaja has heard many times from her father, activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. It’s a story about resistance, fighting the fight, keeping your chin up. Ultimately though, it’s a story about hope.</p>
<p>‘You’re always so close before you give up,’ 27-year-old Maryam says. She is the co-director of the  <a href="http://www.gc4hr.org/">Gulf Centre for Human Rights</a> (GCHR) and, because of her prominence as an activist, she was arrested in September 2014 upon her arrival at Bahrain’s Manama airport.</p>
<p>‘When I was stopped at the airport, I was assaulted by four policewomen, held incommunicado for more than 10 hours, and put into a freezing room – the temperature was turned down to such a degree that even the policewoman didn’t want to sit in the same room with me. I was not allowed to pray or go to the bathroom for hours. I wasn’t allowed to speak to anyone.’</p>
<p>She was released under a travel ban and, when it was lifted, she left the country. Eventually, she was charged with assaulting a police officer and sentenced in absentia to a year in prison.</p>
<p>Arrests are commonplace in her family, who have always been staunch protesters against the al-Khalifa monarchy’s authoritarian rule. Her father is currently serving a life-term for ‘plotting to overthrow the king’ during the Bahraini uprising of 2011; her sister Zeynab was sentenced to four years in prison and could be arrested at any time. Her brother-in-law has also been arrested and tortured, and her uncle is serving five years in prison.</p>
<p><strong>Crackdown on dissent</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, arrests are everyday occurrences throughout Bahrain. Ever since the 2011 uprising, which was quashed by the government (with Saudi Arabia’s military help), the country has waged a systematic crackdown on all forms of dissent, and human rights abuse is rampant, often perpetrated with the silent approval of its foreign allies – Saudi Arabia, Britain, and the US.</p>
<p>‘Keeping up with the day-to-day arrests, the new cases, is a 24-hour job,’ says Maryam. ‘In a country as small as Bahrain, [there were] 89 people arrested in one week, which is a very high per-capita percentage. And that includes children a lot of times.’</p>
<p>The newly arrested disappear for a while – sometimes hours, sometimes weeks – and most of them report being tortured, as the Bahrain Center for Human Rights has documented. Maryam’s father has also spoken publicly of the sexual abuse he was subjected to in prison, trying to raise awareness of the regime’s brutality.</p>
<p>‘There’s a sense of numbness. This has been happening for such a long time – the sense of fear has been replaced with numbness and anger and frustration’</p>
<p>‘I’ve never talked to my father about the torture he’s endured,’ says Maryam. ‘He’s still in high spirits when I talk to him, he jokes, he laughs, seems quite himself. I’ve talked to my brother-in-law a lot, who was arrested at the same time as my father, and I’ve spoken to him about the torture he endured. But with my father… I don’t know how he’s coped with it. [The torture] is a part of the experience that many of us are very hesitant to visit – not a subject we would necessarily open up unless the other party does so.’</p>
<p>Bahrainis aren’t oblivious to what’s happening, either. ‘People are very highly educated, they follow the news. Most know what’s going on, even though they might not know specific cases. You could stop people on the street and ask them and they probably would know.’</p>
<p>The government’s intimidation tactics work for the most part, though. In the rural, Shi’a-dominated areas, teargas nighttime raids are a common occurrence and, because Bahrain is so small, the gas can sometimes reach the high-powered diplomatic or financial districts.
There is severe state-level censorship in Bahrain, and people have taken to Twitter to show just how frustrated they are with the regime.</p>
<p>‘Twitter has become the platform for Bahrainis to document, organize, communicate – you put everything on Twitter. As soon as someone gets shot, you take a picture, you put it on Twitter – you can get minute-by-minute updates of what’s happening on the ground, as it’s happening.</p>
<p>‘It’s not always a good thing: one of the problems we have, as activists, is convincing people not to [immediately] upload pictures of people who have been severely injured, which could get them arrested – the government can identify them when they go for treatment.’</p>
<p><strong>Spyware and threats</strong></p>
<p>Because Twitter is so popular and out of the state’s control, the government is continually trying to undermine it.</p>
<p>‘The government quickly learned that you don’t shut off the internet – you use it, you make it your own tool. There are [government] people operating on Twitter, defaming activists, going after anyone and everyone who speaks about Bahrain or criticizes the state.’</p>
<p>The Bahraini government also uses expensive spyware programs, usually bought from EU-based companies, in order to identify troublesome users, track them down and arrest them.
In these circumstances, are people not afraid? ‘I don’t know that I would call it fear. I feel like there’s a sense of numbness. This has been happening for such a long time – the sense of fear has been replaced with numbness and anger and frustration.’</p>
<p>Maryam herself has received countless violent threats, and has learned in time to take them seriously – the government’s eyes can reach all the way to London or Copenhagen, where she spends a lot of her time doing advocacy work for Bahraini human rights.</p>
<p>She knows that she’s probably being watched, and has come to see it as something to be expected, part of the job.</p>
<p>‘One of the things you do as an activist is you detach yourself from everything emotionally, because if you don’t, you can’t do the work that you do. Especially in a place like Bahrain, where so many people that you report on are people you know personally. Even the idea of having to deal with the emotional aspect of the work that we do is very difficult in itself. I feel like it’s Pandora’s box – once it’s open, I won’t be able to control it.’</p>
<p>And the work is important. The West’s collusion with Bahrain’s human rights abuse, the country’s domestic policies, which only serve to push a sectarian agenda, further dividing the population, the complete lack of accountability of the regime – they’re all issues about which Maryam and the GCHR are fighting to raise awareness.
‘These [foreign] governments look at Bahrain geopolitically, and to them it makes more sense to continue enabling a government which continues to commit human rights abuses on a daily basis, than to uphold it to these very basic principles. We’re asking for a very simple thing: a special session at the Human Rights Council in Geneva; a resolution, a stop on the arms trade, which have been used to kill protesters. These very simple things that should have happened in 2011, we’re still asking for in 2015.’</p>
<p>There’s a long way ahead, as Bahrain’s relationship with its Western allies seems stronger than ever – indeed, Britain recently signed an agreement with the kingdom to build a permanent UK naval base there. Meanwhile, the combined power of Bahrain’s Sunni ruling minority and the country’s religious extremism have turned it into the perfect ‘incubator’ for ISIS ideology.</p>
<p>‘It has to get to that point where people break down that wall of fear, like it happened in 2011, when people just said “enough is enough”. And a lot of times, it’s not just the poverty that brings people to that point, it’s the undignified way of treating people, when you rob people of their dignity, of their basic humanity, when you push them to a point where they feel like they need to fight back.’</p>
<p>‘Part of the resistance is staying positive, optimistic,’ Maryam says in her matter-of-fact tone. ‘It’s showing them that they can’t break you. The day you stop smiling, the day that you stop fighting, that’s the day they win.’</p>

<p>Oleg Sentsov always wanted to be a filmmaker. The trouble is that filmmakers also need to be truth-tellers, and truth-telling is a much-frowned-upon activity in today’s Russia.
In May last year, the 38-year old Ukrainian director was arrested in his home in Simferopol, Crimea, by Russian police.
A year later, Sentsov is still awaiting trial.</p>
<p>Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), a modern embodiment of the KGB, has accused him of terrorist activities on Russian territory, including plotting attacks on railway bridges, power lines and public monuments in three key Crimean towns – Simferopol, Sevastopol and Yalta.</p>
<p>At the crux of the matter is Crimea itself, a territory disputed by Ukraine and Russia since the 19th century. Ukraine’s political grip weakened after the pro-EU Maidan protests of January 2014. The following month, pro-Russian armed forces took control of Crimea and in March, a ‘referendum’ in the area <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26606097">resulted</a> in 95.5 per cent of voters supporting a union with Russia.</p>
<p>Sentsov, who is of Crimean origin, was actively opposed to Russian annexation. He was a member of AutoMaidan – the automotive wing of the pro-EU Maidan protests – which involved drivers delivering food and supplies in hard-to-reach places.</p>
<p>Andrew Wilson, a Senior Policy Fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations and an expert on Ukrainian politics, says: ‘Sentsov is a political prisoner and hostage. Russia doesn’t want anybody challenging its “project” in Crimea, and many Crimean Tatar activists have been arrested or disappeared. Sentsov is an articulate intellectual who can lay out an attractive vision of why the peninsula ought to belong to Ukraine.’</p>
<p>Sentsov’s case has sparked outrage across the film industry in Europe, with an immediate response from the European Film Academy (EFA), where <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/10/ken-loach-mike-leigh-ukraine-russia-director-oleg-sentsov">directors</a> such as Ken Loach and Pedro Almodóvar signed <a href="https://www.europeanfilmacademy.org/News-detail.155.0.html?&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=223&amp;cHash=01c841fe7c3fefa4b278d933ba750e31">an open letter</a> calling for his release.</p>
<p>This March, the Polish Film Academy organized a <a href="http://variety.com/2015/film/global/free-oleg-sentsov-polish-film-academy-joins-fight-to-release-ukrainian-filmmaker-1201447770/">protest</a> on behalf of Oleg Sentsov during a ceremony in Warsaw, and with the Cannes Festival underway, the Ukrainian Pavilion will host a <a href="http://www.screendaily.com/news/sentsov-now-a-year-in-detention-in-russia/5087727.article">petition</a> supporting his release.</p>
<p>Although Russia’s <a href="http://osce.usmission.gov/mar_19_russia_crimea_occupation.html">human rights abuses</a> in Crimea are <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2015-0011+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN">well-documented</a>, Sentsov’s arrest is still shocking.</p>
<p>Mike Downey, Deputy Chairman of the European Film Academy thinks Sentsov’s is a case of ‘right man, wrong place, wrong time. There is a bizarre arbitrariness to the Oleg Sentsov case, and honestly – despite my justification for the ongoing campaign – he will be freed as arbitrarily as he was imprisoned. It is in the nature of rule by despot.’</p>
<p>Did the open letter sent by the EFA help in any way?</p>
<p>Downey thinks it has ‘kept the case active in the public eye and made it clear to the FSB and the Russian judicial system (corrupt and unheeding as it is) that Oleg has support from all over the world – and that whatever the outcome of the trial – he will be supported. The case will be brought up again and again, and its injustice will reach a wider and wider audience. Oleg’s lawyers – whose guidance provided outcomes for the Pussy Riot case as well, believe that this is the most effective tool Oleg has.’</p>
<p>The money raised from events supporting Oleg Sentsov will go towards his family and provide resources for his legal backup.</p>
<p>Andrew Wilson thinks ‘any protest from [Sentsov’s] fellow artists is doubly valuable. Putin doesn’t like his empire of myths being undermined, and it helps focus Western attention on the merits of the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar cause. Crimea is not “eternal Russian land”.’</p>
<p>Sentsov is best known for his 2011 debut film <em>Gaamer</em>, about a Ukrainian boy who finds solace in video games. The movie excited interest among the European film community, earning good reviews. His following project, <em>Rhino</em>, was postponed due to the start of the Maidan protests and Sentsov’s involvement in them. .</p>
<p>His trial is being continually postponed and Sentsov faces the propect of up to 20 years in prison on terrorism charges. The FSB has also accused him of being a member of Right Sector, an extremist Ukrainian political party opposed to Russian intervention. Sentsov has denied the claim.</p>
<p>He currently resides in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, a place notorious for its use of torture and abuse. Sentsov himself claims he has been tortured, but his allegations are dismissed by the authorities, according to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/ukraine/report-ukraine/">Amnesty International</a>.</p>
<p>Agnieszka Holland, director and Chair of the EFA, says that support for Sentsov must go on.
‘The drop can destroy the rock,’ she says. ‘It took 10 years of international pressure for [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky; I hope it will go faster for Sentsov. We have to do what we can even if it seems to be hopeless.’</p>
<p>She continues: ‘I have quite a long dissident experience from Poland and Czechoslovakia, before 1989. This kind of visibility has always helped prisoners. But not only them – also ourselves, as an international community of artists and filmmakers. We need to feel and express solidarity with our colleagues in different countries, [who are being] persecuted because they are fighting for freedom.’</p>
<p>‘It was the great Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov who wrote in <em>The Master and Margarita</em> that manuscripts cannot burn. They will remain forever, even when they are destroyed. I don’t believe that a tyrant can destroy artists and art. The most important thing is that Oleg Sentsov believes it as well.’</p>
<p>Release Oleg Sentsov <em>is a work-in-progress of Askold Kurov’s documentary about Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, to be screened during the festival.</em></p>

<p>The attack on the headquarters of French satire magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>, which resulted in the death of 12 people on Wednesday, has triggered a wide range of reactions: from shock and solidarity, to anti-Muslim feelings, clash-of-civilizations arguments and <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2015/01/08/20004-20150108ARTFIG00055-le-financial-times-juge-stupide-la-ligne-editoriale-de-charlie-hebdo-et-se-ravise.php#xtor=AL-155-[facebook]">victim</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/07/charlie-hebdo-islam-prophet-muhammad?CMP=fb_gu">blaming</a>.</p>
<p>While most mainstream media organizations have been quick to condemn them and rally around the inalienability of freedom of speech, in comments and editorials across the world, the very question of whether <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> was right to continually ‘push the limits’ of satire is still being debated.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s just the problem.</p>
<p><em>Charlie Hebdo</em> was not in the business of publishing divisive cartoons for the sake of it. There is an important distinction to be made between criticizing a people and criticizing a set of ideas, which is what all religions are. Similarly, criticizing Islam, or Judaism, or Christianity as a religious whole, is not the same as criticizing these religions’ extreme minority factions, which have real political repercussions in a world where religion should long ago have been stripped of political power.</p>
<p>Freedom of expression does not stop where cultural taboos are in place – in fact, one could argue that its main responsibility lies in challenging those taboos, saying the unspeakable. The right to question is at its most valuable when the stakes are higher, when the danger is greater: when you receive death threats, your headquarters are firebombed and you need police protection to do your job, and you still keep doing it.</p>
<p>However, <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> had been criticized throughout its history, including by the French government, now united in support for the magazine. What was once seen as <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-charlie-hebdo-affair-laughing-at-blasphemy">stupidly</a> adding fuel to the fire, has now become a symbol of France itself, hit in its heart. The 9/11 of France, they’re calling it.</p>
<p>This is the crux of the matter. The attack on <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> is less about religion and much more about politics, the very politics which created the need for it to continue publishing anti-Islamist cartoons. And what would politics be without powerful symbols behind it?</p>
<p>Take the attackers, for example. So different from a lone suicide bomber, with a DIY-bomb strapped to his chest, their modus operandi has been nothing if not sleek, prepared, a clean execution. Their impeccable French, clothes, their knowledgeable movements, their marksmanship – they all spell out a pre-planned visible provocation. They push the boundaries of our fears deep into our safe zones, disproving the theory that attacks like these are rooted in madness, showing instead a carefully thought-out, lucid plan.</p>
<p>It’s a clever, manipulative practice, forcing the hand of a government which has reacted predictably, with strong-arm tactics. By using 9/11 imagery and rushing to brand it a terrorist attack, French officials are linking this atrocity to the ‘war on terror’, suggesting a dangerous future for any possible resolution to the conflict and fuelling yet more war rhetoric. Have we not learned our lesson yet, after 14 years of a failed ‘war on terror’, the consequences of which have directly played into this and similar attacks?</p>
<p>If the French government keeps up this rhetoric, the only possible winners here will be the extreme rightwing and the fundamentalists.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/citations/2015/01/08/25002-20150108ARTFIG00049-marine-le-pen-la-france-doit-etre-en-guerre-contre-le-fondamentalisme.php">Marine Le Pen</a>, the leader of the far-right Front National, has wasted no time devising a strategy on how to maximize votes from this situation. She, too, has embraced the ‘France is at war’ rhetoric, calling for more secure borders and a tougher police force, going so far as to suggest a referendum on the death penalty.</p>
<p>In Germany, the anti-Islam Pegida protesters have just been given a perfect <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/07/us-france-shooting-germany-islam-idUSKBN0KG1TO20150107">excuse</a> for justifying their existence – this is what Europe must be protected against, ‘the likes of them’. In Britain, UKIP leader Nigel Farage has already come out <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/charlie-hebdo-nick-clegg-dismayed-at-nigel-farage-blaming-gross-policy-of-multiculturalism-9964810.html">blaming</a> multiculturalism and a loosey-goosey attitude to immigration for the attacks, raking in more votes.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, somewhere in Syria Islamic State (IS)’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is having the best day of his life.</p>
<p>The terrorists have been linked both to al-Qaeda and IS, adding to the confusion, and both organizations – the latter an offshoot of al-Qaeda – stand to gain much from this. Their appeal lies in that revolutionary glow which attracts foreign recruits in their dozens, promising what the ‘Western’ lifestyle as they know it has not been able to deliver: empowerment.</p>
<p>For the many forgotten in the <em>banlieues</em> of the world, constantly alienated in a society which at once demands their integration and prevents it, it’s that promise of power – or its semblance – which is most appealing. If that comes via a religious heatwave, then so be it.</p>
<p>In the midst of these two extremes are countless ordinary citizens, a mainstream Europe of tolerance, for whom multiculturalism is a reality, not wishful thinking. So far, the attacks have prompted people throughout the world to show their <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/08/charlie-hebdo-attack-minutes-silence-victims">solidarity</a> by mobilizing in their thousands, calling for reflection and unity.</p>
<p>How much longer will a moderate attitude survive if tensions continue to rise, escalating with each new attack? Will tolerance and liberal values prevail in the face of the horror of Kalashnikovs ringing out on what was supposedly just an ordinary day?</p>
<p>There is much to be won for extremists from a Europe divided, reduced to nation-states fiercely protecting their borders, dwarfed into political ignominy.</p>
<p>Indeed, the day after the attacks, ‘Freedom has been killed’ was the <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/attaque-contre-charlie-hebdo/article/2015/01/08/la-presse-francaise-defend-sa-liberte-en-une_4551203_4550668.html">headline</a> of many newspapers in France, a signal of just how deeply this has shaken the core of France’s liberal values; exactly the result the attackers were after.</p>
<p>Wanting to make sense of this tragedy is understandable, but to package it into an ‘us’ and ‘them’ issue would be an oversimplification and a strategic mistake (Which us? Which them?). Identity-politics should be cast aside, and unity become more than a slogan.</p>
<p>Already, there is dissension in the ranks of the ‘united’ French government regarding a memorial march scheduled for this Sunday, to which the Front National have apparently not been invited.</p>
<p>Meanwhile of course, there are calls for Muslims to come out and take a stand <a href="http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/2015/01/07/les-musulmans-de-france-redoutent-le-retour-de-flamme_1175810">against</a> the attacks, as if the attacks have anything to do with the majority of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims. As if <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/01/daily-chart-2?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/islamineurope">Islam</a>, as understood by that majority, has any relevance in what is fundamentally an extremist attack which serves a political interest, disguised under the murky layers of religion.</p>
<p>France appears to be at war. Throughout the country, four mosques have been <a href="http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/charlie-hebdo/20150108.OBS9522/plusieurs-mosquees-prises-pour-cible.html">attacked</a> already. The war has begun, but who is fighting it?</p>
<p>As for <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>, its staff have been the tragic victims of a political conflict under the guise of a religious taboo. What would happen if major media outlets around the world dared to show the cartoons tomorrow – would the taboo be broken, or reinforced?</p>

<p>After a full day’s voting, on Sunday 16 November, a ‘Yes we can!’ feeling swept through Romania, taking over social media and reaching all the way to people still queuing outside Romanian embassies throughout Europe, hoping to vote.</p>
<p>Their enthusiasm is understandable. After two weeks of protests amid concerns that the current prime minister, Social-Democrat Victor Ponta, would be elected president, their fears were assuaged.
A little after nine in the evening, it became clear that Klaus Iohannis, a Liberal-Democrat and the mayor of a provincial Transylvanian town, had won, with 54.5 per cent of the vote compared to Ponta’s 45.49 per cent,</p>
<p>These have been the most fiercely contested elections Romania has seen in a long time, with voters’ anger ignited by the voting conditions in the Romanian diaspora.</p>
<p>Never a traditional support base for the Social-Democrats, Romanians abroad were prevented from voting in both election rounds by a stalled voting process and legal debates mired in newspeak and accusations of blame (two foreign ministers have already resigned over the debacle).</p>
<p>Fuelled by social media networks, in the course of the two weeks between the first and second round of elections, public opinion coalesced against the prime minister.</p>
<p>Most of all however, people rallied against the idea that the country was simply up for grabs by the followers of the old communist regime.</p>
<p>In a classic, ironic case of leaders toppling due to self-made enemies, Ponta recast himself as the enemy of most Romanians abroad, increasing their determination to vote in the second round.</p>
<p>In some cases, people queued for more than 11 hours, standing in the cold and rain, waiting for what should have been a matter of routine, a basic democratic tenet – the right to vote. In total, almost 400,000 Romanians voted abroad.</p>
<p>Back home, with a turnout of 62 per cent, Romanians flocked to polling stations, propelled by their friends and family abroad as much as by a sense of urgency and fear. Theirs was a self-defence vote cast out of dread rather than support, something of which the president-elect is very aware.</p>
<p>Klaus Iohannis did not win on his own merit. At 55, more elegant and soft-spoken than the brash Victor Ponta, he is still perceived as a weaker candidate, with relatively little experience in the big political arena.</p>
<p>Still, he has been quick to acknowledge that he understands the message Romanians have sent him: that this is a vote of blind faith, a choice of the ‘lesser evil’ and for some, a hope that the old system can finally be done away with.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at 42 and as one of the youngest European prime ministers, Victor Ponta is the darling of European Social-Democrats. His campaign relied heavily on honing this Western-leader image. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, also a Social-Democrat, even went on Romanian television to give Ponta his support.</p>
<p>Many Romanians, however, associate his image less with European leaders and more with local moguls and party leaders sponging off the state’s resources, whose names are constantly popping up in numerous corruption trials.</p>
<p>His particular brand of ‘shadow politics’ is less than appealing to an increasingly young electorate which is becoming more politically astute and less willing to accept leaders with seemingly unbreakable ties with corrupt politicians, all eager to see a ‘friend’ in the top seat of the country.</p>
<p>And yet Ponta has a stable support base of traditional voters. A more seasoned politician, he was at a clear advantage during the elections and could easily have slid into the president’s seat, had he stuck to a clean campaign against a relatively unknown adversary.</p>
<p>His fate was sealed by the ire he triggered in an otherwise latent, young electorate, by dragging his feet on the diaspora vote issue and refusing to acknowledge the corruption plaguing his party.</p>
<p>On election night, people across the country protested against Ponta, with 10,000 gathered in front of the government building in the capital Bucharest, all demanding his resignation.
Throughout the day, news of voting fraud taking place in the south of the country had filtered through social media, while footage of mile-long queues abroad had already aired in prime time.</p>
<p>When the exit polls started predicting Iohannis as the winner, the protests turned into a street celebration.</p>
<p>That is perhaps the best outcome of the elections: not the fact that Iohannis has won, but that Romanians have found a common idea to rally around, one heartfelt enough to draw them out of their houses and into the streets in their thousands.</p>
<p>They wish for a different Romania, where the ‘smart guys’ don’t always win, where politics is about more than personal gain and where leaders are held accountable for their actions (or lack thereof). Most of all, a Romania which allows them a future.</p>
<p>Now, in the first post-election week, it’s more important than ever not to forget that. Iohannis might have polled better than Mr Ponta, but he, too, is surrounded by ‘faithful’ party cronies, who should be shown the door as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Any hope in Iohannis’ integrity or political astuteness is misplaced. Instead, what is needed is increased awareness of the political games being played out in Parliament, now facing a weakened Socialist majority and a slowly crumbling coalition.</p>
<p>More significantly, Romanians should realize that this was not Iohannis’ win, but their own. If they want to set the country on a better trajectory, they should not forget that.</p>

<p><strong>How did you decide to make this documentary?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greg Barker:</strong> I was very interested in [the concept of] revolution and I spent a lot of time looking at how contemporary events were informed by actions of the past. I was inspired by the people who are standing up for the ideals that helped build the countries that we live in and wanted to tell a story that really explored what it takes to stand up to those ideals and the sacrifices that people have to make.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose those three countries?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> In a film like this, you can have an infinite number of choices so it’s really just through research and spending a lot of time with people… eventually, these were the ones that seemed to have an interesting way of telling a story.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong, it’s just making the choice that these particular characters, in these countries, represented the full scope of the revolutionary experience, from armed struggle to non-violence.</p>
<p><strong>The movie opens with interesting credits, depicting controversial revolutionary figures such as Lenin, Mao Zedong and Ayatollah Khomeini. Didn’t you fear that association?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> No matter what you think about Mao or Che or Lenin, just like the American revolutionaries, they actually talked a lot about revolutions. Whether you agree with what they did, they spent a lot of time thinking about what revolutions involve and what they entail and why they happen.</p>
<p>That’s an academic exercise that they all did, which is independent of what they then did in the course of their own revolutions.</p>
<p>When Zhou Enlai [..] was asked by [Henry] Kissinger what he thought about the French revolution, he said ‘it’s too early to tell’. These things take a long time.</p>
<p>These are people whom I wanted to reflect the full breadth of the revolutionary experience, because it’s not always pretty and it’s not always what we might like or even what the people who began it would have liked.</p>
<p>Khomeini’s revolution in Iran had the support of a broad segment of society and then changed quickly in the ensuing years. The French Revolution was about one thing and then turned into something else. It’s not an easy or a pretty process.
<strong>Watching the movie, it felt like you took a step back from what we’re seeing, but that you also left the context slightly unclear.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> You have to give a sense of the human drama, of the human experience of it all, rather than a report of what happened. So we all felt it was important to focus on the journey of these people and the ethical and tactical choices that they make along the way.</p>
<p>And because when you make a film like this, it’s not going to last for years – events change and the outcome now won’t be the outcome in five or 10 years – you make a film that is rooted in a moment in time. It doesn’t try to say: ‘This is where we are’.</p>
<p>The fact is, it would be outdated if we tried to do that. We finished this film in January, so much has already happened [since then]. You have to make the film in a way that you hope will stand the test of time, it’s very tricky when you’re dealing with current events, but that’s the nature of this art.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel that by focusing this much on these three families, and less on the context, you risk idealizing the figure of the revolutionary?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB:</strong> I don’t think so. It’s pretty tragic what happens to all of them. What I would say is that it might be a noble path, but not one that I would want to take lightly. I don’t know that I would watch the film and think ‘I want to be a revolutionary’, probably on the contrary – but in the end, history is changed by people who do that.</p>
<p>Not for me to say that they’re idealized, but I think that if you look at key figures throughout history, often, people who are the idealists are the ones who leave their mark and stand the test of time. Lenin was also a revolutionary and an idealist in his own way, and things changed after the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>I think that if you look at [Mahatma] Gandhi, [Martin Luther] King, [Nelson] Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, these are people who stood up for something, and they were just ordinary people when they began their campaign – three years after they started, Mandela was in jail for life, King was still a fairly small time preacher in the South and Aung San Suu Kyi was still a mother. You can’t judge the impact of these people until time passes.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say we idealize it, but I think people who become heroes, do so in a way that, at the time you’re looking at them, looks pretty mundane and often hopeless, and the journey can seem almost irrelevant or foolish at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Still, knowing how perverted things have become in Syria, it seems that the path to revolution is not always noble. And the documentary didn’t really show that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GB</strong>: It’s not always noble. Again, we’re not making a film that tries to explain all the context, I really wanted to show what happened when people began on a non-violent path, and then, for a lot of seemingly different, valid reasons, decide that they have to take up arms anyway. Like Mandela did, actually. It’s a common phenomenon; it’s the price they paid, the consequence.</p>

<p>Maryam al Khawaja is a dual national, Danish and Bahraini. Her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, has been in prison since 2011, following protests against he Bahraini government, and her sister and mother have been arrested as well. Maryam was arrested on 30 August 2014, when she landed in Manama, Bahrain, trying to visit her family.</p>
<p><strong>The documentary leaves off with your sister in and out of jail, you still abroad, but things have changed since then. You’ve managed to go back to Bahrain twice and you were arrested there in August.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maryam al-Khawaja:</strong> Things changed – Zainab [Maryam’s sister] got out seven months ago, in February; I went back and got arrested, I went to prison for a while and then I got out [in September 2014]. Now things are back to where they started: I’m outside, doing advocacy work, and Zainab’s back in prison.</p>
<p><strong>And she’s eight months pregnant too. Do you think she’s going stay in prison until she gives birth?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> Yes, she had a hearing. It was supposed to be a sentencing, but the judge adjourned the trial until 4 December. My analysis is that it’s probably related to the fact that there are elections happening on 22 November, and so it’s really bad PR to sentence her right now.</p>
<p>But it also means that because she’s in her last month of pregnancy, she will probably be giving birth during her imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong>You do a lot of advocacy work, and are very public about it, and so is your family. Have you or your family ever had any qualms about taking part in this documentary?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> The documentary hasn’t been made fully public yet [at the time of the interview] so I haven’t really seen what the response from the public is generally going to be.</p>
<p>I do know that in the past, we have had criticism from people saying ‘You’re doing this to be in the spotlight, this is all about you’. I’ve heard that kind of talk before.</p>
<p>It was because of the position that I was in, doing the human rights work that I was doing and getting a lot of interviews. And it was mostly non-Bahrainis, but people were saying ‘You’re doing this because you want the attention.’</p>
<p>Which is fair enough, they’re entitled to their opinion. I think that for us, what’s been challenging, and this is something that was a challenge for me about the documentary itself.</p>
<p>When Razan Ghalayini [co-producer] first contacted me about the documentary, first, she asked me a lot of questions, and I thought she was working for Bahraini intelligence, so I didn’t want to talk to her.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I told her that my only reservation about doing this documentary, the only way that I would agree to do it, is if they promise to make sure that it’s about Bahrainis, about Bahrain, even if we’re in it. That it’s about the Bahraini struggle, not about us.</p>
<p>So I don’t mind us being used as a vessel to bring out the story of what people are going through inside the country. That’s the way I see myself, as an amplifier to people who don’t’ have a voice inside the country.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like the documentary accurately portrays that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> To a large degree yes, I think it talks about what’s going on in Bahrain. They gave me and my sister the space to talk about how we are not what matters when it comes to Bahrain, how it’s about the people’s struggle. For me, that was very important.</p>
<p>Our job is to fight for those people, that’s our responsibility. Even if the movie was mainly about me and my sister and my family, I feel like it gave us an opportunity to talk about what you will usually not hear in Bahrain.</p>
<p><strong>There was a very striking image in the documentary, with men and women on either side of a large avenue, protesting, but separated. In Bahrain, how relevant is that image for daily interaction between men and women, in politics, in social spaces?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> It is and it isn’t. I know that when they see that image, generally, people’s reaction is ‘Oh, Muslims, they separate men and women.’ For me, it’s pretty impressive that they’re walking alongside each other.</p>
<p>There’s no space in the street to be walking next to each other, but the fact that the women are not walking behind the men is an important image.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes, it’s just about being comfortable. I’ve been in those protests and I’m what you may call a liberal. For me, it wasn’t an issue of being around men or not, it was about being in all of this together.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was more comfortable to not be in a position where I’m constantly around men and in a very small space. Sometimes, it’s just more comfortable to be around women. It’s not necessarily something that was done as a statement of separation between the sexes.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel that as an activist, your access to doing certain things has been restricted or freed up by the fact that you’re a woman?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> That’s not a very easy question to answer. I know that some of the platforms that I’ve gotten, I got because I wear a hijab. And because I’m a woman of colour.</p>
<p>People are saying ‘Oh look, there’s this Arab hijabi woman… check check check, she knows how to speak English very well, she’s talking about human rights and revolutions, we have to have her on this platform’.</p>
<p>I know that my identity and the way I look actually gets me access to some places. And I make use of it. I don’t necessarily always like it; I don’t like the fact that I’m profiled. For example, I’ve gotten invitations in the past asking me to come and talk about Muslim women’s issues.</p>
<p>But I don’t represent Muslim women, I represent myself; and even if I talked about Muslim women’s issues in Bahrain, they’re not going to be the same that people deal with in other places. And I’m not familiar with every issue that Muslim women deal with.</p>
<p>There is to some extent, that pigeonholing, but at the same time, it also provides me with more access; it’s a double edged sword.</p>
<p>For me, it’s about how to make the most of it. And it’s the same thing when I’m talking in places where there is support for the Bahraini government.</p>
<p>For example, a few years ago, my family got an award from a US organization and people were telling me ‘How can you go there, how can you accept this award? These are people who are representing the US government, which is enabling the Bahraini government’.</p>
<p>What I did was, I accepted that award, but I stood there and I bashed US policy in Bahrain. I used my entire speech just to talk about how bad US policy is towards Bahrain. So they might be doing it for the wrong reasons, but I will make use of that platform to get our message out.</p>

<p>When police officer Darren Wilson drew out his gun on the afternoon of 9 August, took aim and shot six bullets into Michael Brown, he had no idea it would trigger a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28863057">riot</a> on the very streets he’d been watching over.</p>
<p>After all, who was Michael Brown? Just another black 18-year-old. More importantly, who did Darren Wilson see when he pulled the trigger? A gentle giant, as his family have called him? A potential troublemaker, a thief? A soon-to-be college undergrad? A national statistic?</p>
<p>And later, when Michael Brown lay dead on that hot Ferguson street for more than four hours, for everyone to see, who was he then? An unfortunate victim of an accident, someone in the wrong place at the wrong time? A mistake? Another lynched black man?</p>
<p>Michael Brown, the person, was many things, most of which the media is only now beginning to piece together, and some of which will largely remain unknown. Michael Brown, the trigger for a protest, is another, altogether more complicated story, which begins in a small town in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Ferguson is a suburban belt of St Louis, Missouri. It’s a town of 21,000, with one of the highest levels of <a href="http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report2.pdf">segregation</a> in the US, where white flight has been a steady <a href="http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/segregation2010/city.aspx?cityid=2923986">phenomenon</a> since the 1980s, and where 69 per cent of the population is black. The town’s institutions don’t reflect this, however, especially the police force, where out of 53 police officers, only three are black.</p>
<p>Numbers are important. They tell a story of their own, one with fixed parameters, which can shine a light on an otherwise muddled tale. For example, while many might suspect that black people are more prone to a stop-and-search, statistics prove it: in Ferguson, they are 1.3 times <a href="http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/Reports.php?lea=161">more likely</a> to be stopped by the police than their white neighbours.</p>
<p>From ‘2006 to 2012, a white police officer <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/melissa_harris_perry_delivers_an_impassioned_tribute_to_unarmed_black_me_killed_by_police/">killed</a> a black person at least <a href="http://www.rolereboot.org/culture-and-politics/details/2014-08-black-unarmed-women-girls-without-weapons-killed-law-enforcement/">twice</a> a week’ in the US. That amounts to more than <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/">400</a> dead. In Ferguson, just 11 days after Michael Brown’s shooting, another young black man was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kajieme-powell-shooting-missouri-police-release-video-footage-of-second-man-killed-by-officers-9682357.html?origin=internalSearch">killed</a> by the police.</p>
<p>Institutionalized racism is not a new phenomenon. The slow depletion of young black men and women from their communities is also not news. Still, something about the death of this young man developed into something else, larger than him, which took over a sleepy town and made headline news all over the world.</p>
<p>In a powerful TIME essay, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has <a href="http://time.com/3132635/ferguson-coming-race-war-class-warfare/">argued</a> that the Ferguson protests are essentially about class. In an equally powerful reply in The Nation, Dave Zirin has <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/181310/my-major-problem-kareem-abdul-jabbars-powerful-essay-ferguson">said</a> that in this situation, racism trumps class.</p>
<p>Why does there need to be a hierarchy?</p>
<p>Michael Brown was so lightly killed because he was black. On US streets, that’s still a synonym for disposable, and it’s still perceived as being inferior.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, he was killed because he was poor. His belonging to a particular community and a particular social class marked him out just as powerfully as his skin colour.</p>
<p>The two, race and class, are not divisible categories here, to be analysed as separate phenomena. They are two sides of the same coin, a reflection of a pervasive social reality. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/aug/19/race-ferguson-inequality-opportunities-african-american-injustice">economics of poverty</a> have everything to do with race, especially in the US. Institutionalized racism leads to fewer social and economic opportunities for non-white Americans, which can spiral into a vicious circle of inequality, anger and injustice.</p>
<p>The ‘wealth gap’ the media talks about is not just between rich and poor; it has a <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/wealth-gap-grows-between-black-and-white-us">racial component</a> as well. Ignoring that means a dangerous slip down ‘American Dream’ territory. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/09/news/economy/america-economic-mobility/">American Dream</a> is just that: a dream.</p>
<p>The Ferguson protests are about more than Michael Brown’s death. They link in to a community’s desperation at seeing its members <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/181332/strange-fruit-ferguson">lynched</a> in broad daylight; to its inability to move out of poverty or to make itself heard, and to a complete disconnect from the people who police its streets and the leaders seen up-close only on TV.</p>
<p>In a sad twist of irony, the protests are taking place while the US has its first black president, serving his second term in the White House. If, at the beginning of his presidency in 2008, anyone expected Barack Obama to have a strong position on pervasive racism in the US, that hope has been extinguished by now. His <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/20/nothing-obama-and-holder-say-will-change-racial-debate/">political</a> ties to the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/barack-obama-ferguson-race-110165.html">conservative right</a> make it impossible for his stance to be anything but conciliatory and neutral, the equivalent of a <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/obama_men_of_color_are_seen_as_objects_of_fear/">weary</a> ‘Keep calm and carry on’.</p>
<p>Twelve days after Michael Brown’s death, the protests are still raging. They’ve been re-appropriated and re-drawn on racial and social lines, with violent youth admonished by the elderly, and everyone targeted by the police. There has been looting and teargas, riot gear and more than 60 arrests. A living hell, seen on live TV.</p>
<p>The question is, will it lead anywhere? Can a wider national movement bring much-needed change to a community brought to the brink, or will this stay a disparate protest of a few hundred people in a country of hundreds of millions?</p>

But what does that mean for its politics? asks <strong>Cristiana Moisescu</strong>.</em></p>
<p>When the sentence came through, there was an immediate, collective response, like a gust of air blowing through a cramped room. Ten years of jail time for the notorious Romanian media mogul, Dan Voiculescu! The people in the courtroom immediately took to social media to spread the news, while journalists scurried out to be the first to broadcast it on national television.</p>
<p>His detractors rejoiced, his supporters shouted ‘foul play!’. At the end of a six-year trial, prolonged due to Voiculescu’s sly maneuvering of the law (which involved, among others, his two-time resignation as a national deputy), Dan Voiculescu was finally <a href="http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-17848522-romanian-mogul-dan-voiculescu-influential-businessman-and-politician-receives-10-year-prison-sentence-corruption-case.htm">convicted</a> on 8 August for money laundering and the $80-million financial loss the Romanian state suffered as a result.</p>
<p>A spate of high-profile convictions has rocked the boat of Romanian politics lately, from ex-Prime Minister <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/06/nastase-returns-to-jail-on-bribery-conviction/">Adrian Nastase</a> to former member of the European Parliament <a href="http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-14202996-romanian-businessman-politician-receives-3-year-sentence-with-conditional-suspension-execution.htm">Gigi Becali</a>.
While the convictions were perceived by international observers as crackdowns on corruption, some Romanians saw them as ‘acts of justice’ <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21605953-traian-basescu-ending-his-presidency-amid-corruption-scandal-oh-brother">maneuvered</a> from the shadows by Traian Basescu, Romania’s president, against his political enemies.</p>
<p>These claims are fuelled by the fact that Basescu’s own party members seem to be immune to corruption charges (although his own brother has recently <a href="http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-17522106-romania-president-39-brother-placed-30-day-preventive-arrest-under-traffic-influence-charges.htm">been questioned</a> ) and that Basescu’s legitimacy has recently come under fire following a countrywide referendum calling for his resignation.</p>
<p>Given that Basescu won both his terms promising a swift clean-out of corrupt politicians, one can see why he would want a couple of big names prosecuted while he’s still in office.</p>
<p>Romania, gearing up for what will likely be a heated presidential election later this year, reacted with mixed feelings to Voiculescu’s sentencing. In the public eye, he is one of President Traian Basescu’s most vocal critics, as well as the owner of one of the biggest media conglomerates in the country, Intact Media Group, which also happens to include the most popular TV news station, Antena 3, watched daily by millions.</p>
<p>In time, there has been a steady alignment between the media channel’s output and the views of its owner, up to the point that they have become indistinguishable. This state of affairs took an ironic twist when the judges also ruled that all of Voiculescu’s assets should be seized and disposed of.</p>
<p>Naturally, this included Antena 3’s headquarters, which suddenly saw itself on the losing side of the law, but with a sympathy vote from its audiences.</p>
<p>Playing the card of ‘media outlet whose voice is being censored by the authorities’ (a dangerous game to play when there are real instances of press freedom restraints in the background), the TV station organized a ‘Freedom March’ the weekend following Voiculescu’s arrest, calling for people to ‘come out and walk against the state’.</p>
<p>It forgot to mention that the court ruling only affected the station’s premises, not its licence to broadcast, and that the only logistical change to its situation was that it would start having to pay rent to the Romanian state.  </p>
<p>The protest gathered around 4,000 people in front of Cotroceni Palace, the Romanian White House equivalent, who marched against the ‘closure’ of the TV station and more importantly, against Traian Basescu. He is seen as the central figure in this political ‘plot’, lurking in the shadows of justice.</p>
<p>The more likely story? In a country where political influence buys you safety, where corruption is still widespread and personal politics equal power, where state procedure can be tweaked to accommodate personal interests, of course the president will be well versed in playing the game.</p>
<p>Are there politicians close to his heart who are corrupt and who might also benefit from a friendly visit from the DNA? There might well be, in which case we could end up hearing all about their convictions once a new president, from a different party, rolls in.</p>
<p>Politicians choose sides, often blatantly enough to be see-through. For example, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta seems to have done just that when writing on his Facebook page, on the day of Voiculescu’s sentencing, that ‘a free country cannot exist without a free press”, referencing Antena 3’s plight, but casually forgetting the details regarding its license to broadcast.</p>
<p>News outlets make or break the electoral vote, and Ponta’s political career has widely benefited from Antena 3’s support and by extension, from Voiculescu’s power capital.</p>
<p>Now however, as he prepares to run in the November presidential election, that political relationship can only harm him. The question on everyone’s lips is, should he become president, will he have the nerve to pardon Voiculescu?</p>
<p>Still, even in countries with such a delicate political balance, a time will inevitably come when important heads start to roll. When ex-prime ministers, ex-ministers and ex-politicians are behind bars for at least some of their dirty deeds; when the richest of the rich – such as Romania’s media moguls of the 1990s – finally learn that their time is up and that their vast wealth can no longer keep justice in check.</p>
<p>That, in itself, is a breath of fresh air, and one that brings hope to many: hope that things are changing, albeit slowly; hope that big egos and big pay cheques can no longer entirely rule the way things are run; and even hope that other big-name politicians sleep less peacefully at night, wondering when their turn will come.</p>

Al-Haddad spoke at SOAS on why ‘riba’ (interest) is prohibited in Islam, but he is also known to hold questionable views regarding FGM, domestic violence and homosexuality.</em></p>
<p>Al-Haddad’s presence at SOAS has triggered numerous complaints and several reports in the media; among the SOAS voices, I have heard people take issue with his extremist views, and the fact that his speaking here turns SOAS into an ‘unsafe space’. My question is – ‘unsafe’ for what?</p>
<p>In my opinion, universities are meant to be safe spaces for learning – about the world and, if we’re lucky, a little about ourselves. While physical and verbal abuse should not be tolerated in universities any more than in other places, the academic environment is one of the few which claims to be an open space for dialogue (this holds especially true at SOAS). This open policy does not come with the caveat “as long as we only talk about what I agree with.”</p>
<p>At the same time, universities shouldn’t be thought bubbles, removed from the world and its diversity of opinions; they are made up of people, each with their own unique vision, and a marker of a safe space is a place where everyone gets to have their say, without fear of being antagonized.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is a funny thing. Probably one of the most commonly accepted traits of democracy, it’s also one of the most controversial. Who do we ‘allow’ a voice to, and who do we expose as a villain for their opinions is a common question. The truth is, we are not in a position to ‘allow’ anything to anyone, and we shouldn’t be. The state guarantees everyone a voice as long as it doesn’t turn into a verbally abusive slur – as long as the voice doesn’t shut down other voices.</p>
<p>In the case of al-Haddad, that’s exactly what some were calling for (never mind that his talk had nothing to do with his other, more contentious ideas). He came into an academic institution, a safe space (sic!) to give a lecture on one particular subject. And while a shade of political correctness has been sidestepped in calling him here, whether he is the most appropriate expert to speak on that topic is irrelevant, as he is qualified to speak on it.</p>
<p>Still, let’s imagine for a second that he was here to talk about his view of homosexuality. Banning his voice wouldn’t have made it disappear – they never do, and a ban would set a very dangerous precedent. The way I see it, he should be free to discuss it, and we should be free to leave the classroom empty. But if we’d be a bit more daring, we’d fill the classroom and talk about it.</p>
